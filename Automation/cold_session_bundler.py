Lazarus Forge - Cold Session Bundler (review/cold_session_bundler.py)

Resolution mechanism for AP-017 (Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md):
    "Adversarial Battery independence requirement undefined"

AP-017's 2026-07-17 clarification is the actual spec this module implements:

    closure requires INFORMATIONAL independence, not merely
    conversational independence. A new chat session is insufficient
    if the prompt carries a curated Assumption Extraction block, a
    summary of prior findings, or "carried forward unless
    contradicted" framing ... The closest available approximation:
    a session given only the raw repository files and the standard
    audit prompt, with no summary of this file's own audit history
    and no prior findings carried forward.

This is a different problem than SectionExtractor (review/section_extractor.py,
formerly living in parser.py). SectionExtractor isolates one section of one
file from that file's own surrounding metadata. This module isolates an
entire audit SESSION from the repository's accumulated judgments about the
target — across however many files carry that history — while still
delivering the raw doctrine text the auditor needs to actually do the job.

Scope and honesty about limits:
    - This is a best-effort heuristic, not a formal guarantee. It cannot
      stop a human operator from pasting extra context into the session
      by hand — it can only refuse to construct that context for them.
    - It distinguishes CURRENT DOCTRINE (Description, Why It Matters,
      Resolution Path — normative, needed) from RETROSPECTIVE FINDINGS
      (Resolution, Advancement, Clarification, Fresh instance notes,
      Surfaced-by attributions, Status/Risk/Last-Reviewed metadata —
      evaluative history that primes a verdict). Only the latter is
      stripped from bundled content.
    - It does not audit the auditor. If a human pastes a curated summary
      into the session after receiving a clean bundle, that's outside
      this tool's control. The bundle's manifest exists so that gap is
      at least visible and checkable after the fact.

        Build a cold session bundle for auditing `target_files`.

        Deliberately, this method's signature has no `prior_findings`,
        `context`, or `summary` parameter. There is nowhere to pass that
        information in even if a caller wanted to — the only inputs are
        which files to audit and (optionally, at construction time) which
        standard prompt to use.

        LIMITATION (v0.1, not yet built): dependency auto-inclusion. If a
        target file references other files (e.g. via a `dependencies:`
        list), those referenced files are NOT automatically pulled in yet
        — only exactly what's listed in `target_files` is bundled. This
        means the self-referential exclusion check currently only applies
        to files you explicitly name; it does nothing until auto-pulled
        dependencies exist to filter. Naming Auditor_Protocols.md directly
        always includes it, by design — you can't audit a file you can't
        see. The exclusion exists to stop it from being pulled in
        silently as unrequested "helpful context" once dependency-following
        is added, not to block a deliberate audit of the file itself.

Lazarus Forge - Shared Audit Library (audit_lib.py)

Extracted from Automation/AUDIT_HARNESS.py, 2026-07-21, so that
Automation/integrity_check.py (repo-wide checks) and AUDIT_HARNESS.py
(single-session audits) both import one implementation of routing
parsing, cross-reference extraction, and finding classification instead
of maintaining two.

This split exists because of a real, named failure pattern from this
repository's own audit history: a concept defined in two places desyncs
the moment one side updates (AP-021, recurred as AP-026). Routing parsing
and cross-reference classification were at risk of becoming a second
instance of exactly that pattern the moment a second tool needed them.
See Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md AP-025/AP-026 and Admin/File_Template.md
§Self-Referential Version Strings for the doctrine this follows.

Public API (previously underscore-prefixed internals of AUDIT_HARNESS.py —
promoted here rather than left private, since they are now an intended
reuse surface, not internal implementation detail):

    parse_routing(content) -> dict
    extract_md_refs(content) -> set
    check_cross_refs(filename, content, registry, aliases, findings) -> None

Also defines Finding, the structured-finding class both tools append to.
Every finding carries severity and category from construction — not
retrofitted onto a plain string later.

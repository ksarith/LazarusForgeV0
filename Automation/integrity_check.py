Lazarus Forge - Repository Integrity Checker (integrity_check.py)

Repo-wide version of checks previously only possible one file at a time
inside a single AUDIT_HARNESS.py session. Imports audit_lib.py and
parser.py rather than reimplementing their logic — see audit_lib.py's
own docstring for why that split exists.

One real dependency worth naming rather than hiding: the Reference Pass
needs a legacy-name ALIASES map to correctly classify LEGACY vs UNKNOWN
cross-references, and that map currently only lives in AUDIT_HARNESS.py
as data. This module imports ALIASES (a dict, not logic) from there.
That is a lesser coupling than duplicating parsing logic would be, but
it is still a dependency — if AUDIT_HARNESS.py's ALIASES import ever
fails, the Reference Pass degrades to an empty alias map rather than
crashing, and says so in its output.

Passes, run in sequence, each appending Finding objects to one shared list:

    1. Walk Repository
    2. Registry Pass       — orphan detection (file exists, not in Routing.md)
    3. Metadata Pass       — Ethical Anchor + File State, via parser.py
    4. Unknown Pass        — duplicate sidecar ID detection
    5. Reference Pass      — cross-reference resolution, via audit_lib.py
    6. Version String Pass — self-citation version drift (AP-025 pattern)
    7. Output              — structured JSON + human-readable summary

Honesty about scope, stated up front rather than discovered later:
    - Registry Pass inherits parse_routing()'s known limitation: files
      with no extension or a space in the name (e.g. the two Admin/
      Tier-0 philosophical documents) cannot be matched by the
      backtick-path regex. These are reported separately as NOTE
      severity ("could not be checked"), never as false-positive
      CRITICAL orphans.
    - Unknown Pass only matches defining occurrences (`### ID` sidecar
      headers), not table-row mentions in Unknowns.md's cross-reference
      index — a mention is not a duplicate definition, and conflating
      the two was the exact false-positive risk flagged when this tool
      was scoped.
    - Version String Pass only catches the specific "FILENAME vX.Y"
      self-citation pattern that caused AP-023/AP-025. It does not
      attempt to locate or verify a file's declared Version String
      Registry entries against arbitrary prose — that would require
      mapping a human-readable section description to actual text,
      which is a judgment task, not a mechanical one. Declining that
      here rather than shipping a heuristic that looks more thorough
      than it is.

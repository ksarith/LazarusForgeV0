## File Purpose

This file defines the design doctrine, functional
architecture, and operational requirements for the
Air Scrubber subsystem of the Lazarus Forge. The
scrubber is an enabling system — without it, the
Forge does not operate. Its purpose is to prevent
release, accumulation, or uncontrolled transformation
of hazardous airborne byproducts generated during
Forge operation.

The Air Scrubber is not a filter appended after the
fact. It is a continuation of the production path.
Every Forge process assumes byproduct generation.
The scrubber is designed around that assumption —
it captures hazards before they escape, converts
mobile hazardous forms into manageable ones, and
provides the sensor matrix that tells the Forge
whether safe operation is occurring. If the scrubber
cannot verify safe operation, the Forge shuts down.

The Gate 4 Cold Verification Harness below
defines the physical testing protocol that must be
executed before hot operations begin. It treats
the sensor matrix as an adversarial system — failure
modes are simulated under cold conditions using
non-hazardous surrogates so that automated interlocks
can be proven before they are needed.

If this file disappeared, operators would lack the
doctrine required to design, operate, and maintain
the safety boundary that makes all other Forge
operations permissible.

## Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Basis | Confidence | Expiry Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Surface and shallow-water variants operate within 500W total system draw | Analogous — industrial scrubbers | Medium | First measured power draw from operational prototype |
| ASM-002 | Variant 4 marine scope is limited to less than 5 atm / 50m depth at v0 power class | Compression work calculation | High | Dedicated high-output compression module available |
| ASM-003 | Negative pressure operation is achievable with salvaged fan/compressor hardware | Analogous — industrial practice | Medium | First prototype demonstrates achievable differential |
| ASM-004 | Thermal sink can be sized to Spin Chamber exhaust load at v0 | Placeholder — exhaust load unknown | Low | `Operations/Gate_05_Separation_Thermal.md` exhaust characterization |
| ASM-005 | Noise from continuous fan/compressor operation exceeds safe exposure limits without PPE | Analogous — industrial fan noise levels | High | Measured SPL confirms otherwise |

---

## Design Philosophy

**1. Capture Is Part of Production**
All Forge processes assume byproduct generation. The
Air Scrubber is a continuation of the production
path, not a cleanup step. Every mode assumes
containment.

**2. Interaction Is Forced, Not Hoped For**
Airflow is deliberately manipulated to increase
residence time and convert mobile hazards into
capturable forms.

**3. Condense, Charge, Cool, Then Capture**
Drop heavy fractions via fractional condensation
loops to protect downstream media → impart a charge
to airborne species to encourage agglomeration →
cool the gas stream to reduce volatility → capture
into liquid or solid phases.

**4. Negative Pressure as a Safety Boundary**
The scrubber operates under slight negative pressure
relative to surroundings. Leaks draw air inward.
Loss of airflow is a critical fault. The Forge
defaults to shutdown rather than uncontrolled
exhaust.

**5. Defeat the Bypass (True Saturation Monitoring)**
A scrubbing system that has reached saturation while
reporting "Airflow OK" is not a scrubber — it is a
bypass. The system must monitor scrubbing liquid
quality alongside differential gas-phase analysis
(Pre- vs. Post-filter) to trigger automated
interlocks before chemical bypass occurs.

**6. Noise Is a Hazard, Not a Side Effect**
Continuous fan and compressor operation produces
sustained noise levels capable of causing permanent
hearing damage and masking critical fault signals.
Hearing protection is required during all scrubber
operation and maintenance. Fault signal audibility
must be verified against ambient noise floor.

```

### Stage A — Sacrificial Mechanical Intercept
Captures coarse particulates and debris. Protects
downstream stages. Designed for frequent replacement
and treated as expendable. Includes mechanical
cyclone separation when dealing with high particulate
loads.

### Stage B — Ionization / Electrostatic Conditioning
Imparts charge to particulates, aerosols, and vapors
to encourage agglomeration and surface attachment.
Ionization energy is moderated. Ozone or unintended
reactive species are monitored as fault conditions.

### Stage C — Thermal Quench / Fractional Condensation Zone
Rapidly lowers gas temperature to encourage
condensation of semi-volatile compounds.

> 🧪 **Hardware Precedent — The Condensation Prerequisite**
> Hardware deployment data indicates that direct-to-carbon
> routing of pyrolysis outgassing causes instantaneous tar
> blinding of the filter media. A multi-stage fractional
> condensation loop (cyclone separator or chilled fluid
> condenser) **must** precede the chemical scrubbing phase
> to drop out heavy oil fractions, paraffins, and waxes.

### Stage D — Wet Scrubbing / Water Column
Absorbs soluble gases and captures charged/agglomerated
particulates. Water is operated in a recirculating
loop with continuous chemical monitoring.

- **Thermal Sink Requirement:** Hot exhaust from
  the Spin Chamber transfers heat to scrubbing water.
  Stage D requires an explicit, ruggedized thermal
  sink interface (heat exchanger, radiator, or passive
  cooling surface) sized to the expected exhaust heat
  load.
- **Corrosion Isolation:** Wet venturi or water-bubbler
  stages handling exhaust from halogenated materials
  must utilize heavy-walled HDPE or 316L stainless
  steel hulls to resist accelerated hydrochloric acid
  pitting.

### Stage E — Polishing / Last-Chance Chemisorption Bed
Captures residual contaminants that escape primary
stages.

> 🧪 **Hardware Precedent — Chemisorption Overrides**
> Standard granular activated carbon (GAC) exhibits
> poor retention for light-fraction toxic syngas
> components (e.g., carbon monoxide, formaldehydes,
> methane). Where high-temperature reduction or
> synthetic polymer processing is active, the final
> stage dry-bed **must** integrate an active
> chemisorbent media, such as alumina impregnated with
> potassium permanganate (KMnO₄), to permanently
> chemically neutralize low-molecular-weight VOCs.

---

## Mechanical & Physical Safety

- **Anti-Flashback Assemblies:** All lines routing
  non-condensable syngas or pyrolysis outgassing back
  into process furnaces or flares must feature a
  verified dual-mesh inline explosion-proof flashback
  arrestor to prevent flame propagation back into the
  air scrubber assembly.
- **Containment Enclosure:** All high-pressure
  fittings and liquid sumps must reside inside a
  co-contained workspace pan to capture liquid
  overflow or secondary gas leakages.

---

## Wet Capture Variants

### Variant 0 — Positive Pressure Enclosure Protection (Simplest)
The pressure-differential principle works in both
directions. Where primary scrubbing uses negative
pressure to contain hazards inside a process box,
positive pressure protects a clean operator or
instrument space by pushing air outward through
every structural gap — dust and contaminants must
fight the outward velocity to enter.

- **Applications:** Operator cab or control room
  in a dusty Forge environment; critical electronics
  enclosures.
- **Implementation:** A blower draws ambient air
  through a multi-stage filter (coarse pre-filter
  protecting a finer main filter) and pressurizes
  the protected space. Controlled exits (door seals,
  pressure relief vents) maintain differential without
  over-pressurizing.

### Variant 1 — Aerated Pond-Style Bubbler (Baseline)
Simple tank with a submerged porous diffuser. Gas is
forced through water via fine bubbles. Prioritizes
simplicity, robustness, and ease of inspection.
**Primary v0 baseline.**

### Variant 2 — Packed Column with Recirculation (Intermediate)
Vertical column with random packing or salvaged scrub
media. Counter-current gas–liquid contact provides
higher efficiency with a modest increase in system
pressure drop.

### Variant 3 — Conditioned Intake + Wet Polish (Future)
Upstream ionization stage feeds a wet stage used
primarily for capture and quench. Reserved for
high-energy or highly variable feeds.

### Variant 4 — Shallow-Depth Marine Bubble-Column (Near-Term Marine)
Scoped strictly to shallow water (less than 5 atm /
~50m depth) for v0. Deep-sea variants route directly
to `Admin/Trajectories.md` target milestones.

- Inject compressed air through pressure-rated
  submerged diffusers.
- Aerate low-dissolved-oxygen (DO) water and capture
  volatiles (H₂S, CO₂) at the surface.
- Onboard sensors track real-time pH, DO, turbidity,
  and gas composition.
- Target bubble sizes: 80–500 μm.
- Column depth: 1–3 m.
- **Quantitative Targets:** 10–30% DO saturation
  increase in less than 2 mg/L hypoxic water; energy
  draw less than 100 W per 1–2 m³ plume.

---

## Energy Awareness

Conceptual ballpark ranges (non-binding, Earth surface
standard conditions):

- Fan/compressor draw: 50–150 W
- Ionization stage: 10–30 W
- Wet-stage recirculation: 20–80 W
- Thermal sink (heat exchanger / radiator): Sized
  dynamically to Spin Chamber exhaust heat load.

**Goal:** Maintain less than 500 W total system draw
for surface and shallow-water variants. Deep-sea
variants are a separate power class.

---

## Sensor Layout & Automated Failure Interlocks

The scrubber uses a multi-point differential diagnostic
grid. If the scrubber cannot verify safe operation via
this matrix, the Forge core triggers an automated
shutdown sequence.

| Diagnostic Metric | Detection Method | Actionable System Threshold | Automated Interlock Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Media Saturation** | Dual VOC PID Sensors (Pre- vs. Post-Filter Differential) | Efficiency drop to less than 85% capture | Trigger **System Fault 04**; Halt downstream heating elements; Force auxiliary air bypass. |
| **Particulate Blinding** | Differential Pressure (ΔP) Transducers across HEPA/Carbon pack | ΔP ≥ 450 Pa over clean baseline | Trigger **Filter Restriction Alert**; Initiate automated mechanical shaker or lock out milling spindle. |
| **Acidic Ingress (HCl/HF)** | Post-scrubber electrochemical gas sensor / pH probe in wet sumps | Sump pH less than 5.5 or Exhaust greater than 5 ppm | Instantaneous **E-Stop Lockout** of Pyrolysis Reactor core. |
| **Thermal Saturation** | Thermocouples in Stage D liquid core | Temperature exceeds rated fluid threshold | Trigger **Thermal Fault**; Divert feedstocks away from primary thermal reduction units. |
| **Noise Fault Masking** | Ambient microphone calibration check | Alarm audio margin less than 10 dB above operating noise floor | Flash high-intensity visual strobes; Flag system failure to supervisory network layer. |

---

## Waste as a Managed Output

Captured materials are not disposable nuisances.

- Liquids, sludges, and solids are routed into
  controlled handling paths.
- Sump chemical composition is monitored as a
  primary diagnostic signal.
- **Disposition:** (1) test for reuse potential;
  (2) if hazardous, immobilize per applicable
  regulations; (3) if inert, route to bulk
  material recovery.

---

## Compatibility With Autonomous Operation

The Air Scrubber is designed to operate continuously
without manual tuning, provide clear health signals
to supervisory systems, and fail into containment
rather than release. Human oversight is optional;
stewardship is not.

  exhaust source; thermal load on Stage D sized to
  Spin Chamber output.

  preservation enabler during artifact recovery.
- `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md` — Noise exposure limits,

  for scrubber operations.

---

## Summary Doctrine

The Air Scrubber is not a filter. It is a boundary
system that forces hazardous matter into managed forms,
prevents accidental chemistry, and makes responsible
operation possible at scale.

A Forge that cannot clean up after itself is incomplete
by definition. And a scrubber that does not know when
it is full is a liability.

---

## Gate 4 Cold Verification Harness

This protocol governs the physical and logical
verification of the differential diagnostic grid
defined above. Testing must be performed in sequence,
using non-hazardous surrogates, with the primary Forge
heating elements and feedstock intake mechanically
and electrically isolated.

Successful execution of all four protocols is the
physical evidence required to advance Spec Gates
from 3/6 to 4/6. Results are logged in the Test
Execution Matrix below and contributed to
`Admin/Verification_Gates_LF.md`.

### Pre-Test Safety & Harness Setup

Before executing any sensor verification loop:

1. **Isolate Power Hooks:** Physically disconnect
   the main power lines to the Pyrolysis Reactor
   core heaters and the milling spindle. Verify air
   scrubber fan/compressor power is routed through
   the secondary safety relay loop.
2. **PPE Baseline:** Full face shield and nitrile
   gloves are mandatory during wet sump adjustments.
3. **Log Initialization:** Initialize
   `Admin/AUDIT_HARNESS.py` in listen-only mode to
   capture real-time state transitions on the local
   bus.

### Protocol 1.1 — Media Saturation Interlock (VOC PID)

Verifies dual photoionization detector (PID)
differential capture logic without generating toxic
outgassing.

- [ ] **Step 1 (Baseline Verification):** Power on
  the primary air scrubber fan. Verify that
  Sensor_VOC_Pre and Sensor_VOC_Post settle within
  ±2% of each other in ambient air. Check that the
  control layer reads System Status: Nominal.
- [ ] **Step 2 (Surrogate Injection):** Introduce a
  controlled hydrocarbon surrogate (e.g., exposing
  an open container of isopropyl alcohol near Stage
  A's intake manifold).
- [ ] **Step 3 (Differential Calibration):** Monitor
  the live bus telemetry. Confirm that Sensor_VOC_Pre
  spikes immediately while Sensor_VOC_Post remains
  flat, proving the downstream polishing media is
  active.
- [ ] **Step 4 (Fault Simulation):** Artificially
  force a saturation bypass state. Place a secondary
  surrogate source directly at the Stage E exhaust
  sensor to simulate breakthrough efficiency dropping
  below 85%.
- [ ] **Step 5 (Interlock Check):** Verify that the
  system registers **System Fault 04** within
  < 500 ms. Confirm that the control loop opens the
  primary safety relay, immediately cutting simulation
  power to downstream heating elements.

### Protocol 1.2 — Particulate Blinding Interlock (ΔP)

Verifies differential pressure transducers accurately
flag filter restriction before an over-pressure event
occurs.

- [ ] **Step 1 (Baseline):** Read static pressure
  across HEPA/Carbon pack with fan at max RPM.
  Record ΔP_clean.
- [ ] **Step 2 (Restriction Simulation):** Restrict
  airflow to Stage E by gradually blocking the filter
  chamber face with an inert, non-porous template
  plate.
- [ ] **Step 3 (Alert Threshold):** Monitor pressure
  transducer output. Verify that when ΔP increases
  to ≥ 450 Pa over ΔP_clean, a **Filter Restriction
  Alert** fires on the local operator display.
- [ ] **Step 4 (Actuator Loopback):** Confirm that
  the system automatically sends a pulse train to
  the automated mechanical shaker assembly (if
  equipped) or flags an immediate lockout command
  to the milling spindle bus.
- [ ] **Step 5 (Reset Check):** Remove the restriction
  template. Verify differential pressure drops back
  to baseline and the alert state auto-clears within
  3 seconds.

### Protocol 1.3 — Acidic Ingress Interlock (Sump pH & Gas Phase)

Verifies the system can protect its structural hull
from chemical degradation caused by halogenated
polymer exhaust.

- [ ] **Step 1 (Sump Calibration):** Calibrate the
  Stage D wet sump pH probe using standard buffer
  solutions (pH 4.0 and pH 7.0). Re-insert probe
  into recirculating fluid loop.
- [ ] **Step 2 (Acid Injection):** Using a precision
  pipette, slowly introduce 0.1M HCl solution
  directly into the Stage D sampling well to simulate
  acidic bypass.
- [ ] **Step 3 (E-Stop Trigger):** Observe the
  telemetry bus. The moment the reading dips below
  pH 5.5, the system must execute an instantaneous
  **E-Stop Lockout**.
- [ ] **Step 4 (Line Isolation):** Verify via
  multimeter that the Pyrolysis Reactor core main
  power contactor has dropped open. The contactor
  must open physically and latch into a locked state;
  software-only overrides are a failure.
- [ ] **Step 5 (Neutralization Test):** Add sodium
  carbonate to return the sump to pH 7.0. Verify
  that the system *prohibits* a clear-fault command
  until a manual operator attestation code is
  entered.

### Protocol 1.4 — Noise Fault Masking Interlock

Ensures acoustic alarms remain audible above ambient
fan and compressor noise.

- [ ] **Step 1 (Noise Floor Measurement):** Fire up
  all fan, pump, and compressor modules to maximum
  operating velocity. Place a calibrated sound level
  meter at the primary operator station. Record
  baseline dBA level.
- [ ] **Step 2 (Acoustic Injection):** Use an
  integrated test function to fire the audible
  emergency alarm horn.
- [ ] **Step 3 (Audibility Check):** Measure the
  combined acoustic output. The alarm signal must
  maintain a minimum margin of ≥ 10 dBA above the
  operating noise floor recorded in Step 1.
- [ ] **Step 4 (Optical Redundancy):** While the
  alarm is firing, verify that high-intensity visual
  strobes activate across all facility quadrants
  simultaneously.
- [ ] **Step 5 (Supervisor Attestation):** Unplug
  the primary horn to simulate acoustic alarm failure.
  Verify that the local microphone detects the
  missing signal and instantly flags a network
  supervisor warning.

### Test Execution Matrix

Use this table to record physical verification cycles
before updating File State Spec Gates to 4/6.

| Test ID | Targeted Interlock | Expected Software State | Hardware Action Verified? | Response Latency | Pass / Fail |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **V4-AS-01** | VOC Breakthrough (<85%) | System Fault 04 | Heating Relay Drops Open | ________ ms | [ ] P  [ ] F |
| **V4-AS-02** | Pressure Blinding (≥450 Pa) | Filter Restriction Alert | Spindle Lockout Active | ________ ms | [ ] P  [ ] F |
| **V4-AS-03** | Sump Acid Ingress (pH < 5.5) | Core E-Stop Lockout | Contactors Mechanically Tripped | ________ ms | [ ] P  [ ] F |
| **V4-AS-04** | Alarm Audibility Margin (<10 dB) | Acoustic Masking Warning | Visual Strobes Triggered | ________ ms | [ ] P  [ ] F |

### Post-Verification Action

If all four protocols achieve Pass status:

1. Append verified checklist data to the
   `Admin/Verification_Gates_LF.md` log tracking
   repository.
2. Update the Spec Gates field in File State from
   3/6 to 4/6.
3. Shift Body Stability from Transitional to Stable
   for sections covered by Gate 4 verification.

**Description:** Whether 500W worst-case scrubber
draw (surface/shallow variants) is compatible with
Forge power budget at bootstrap and nominal modes.
Thermal sink power is not yet validated in this loop.

**Why It Matters:** If scrubber + thermal sink exceeds
20% of bootstrap power budget, the Forge cannot operate
the scrubber at full capacity during bootstrap mode —
which means hot operations cannot proceed. The scrubber
is a prerequisite, not an optional load.

**Resolution Path:** Cross-reference against
`Operations/Energy.md` Power Demand stub. Flag if
scrubber + thermal sink exceeds 20% of bootstrap
budget. Payment via Specification — once first
operational power draw is measured, move energy
estimates to Measured.

**Description:** Detailed specification for deep-sea
Variant 4+ (greater than 50m / 5 atm) remains
undefined.

**Why It Matters:** Deep-sea operation is a
`Tests/Leviathan_testing.md` deployment requirement.
Without a specification, Leviathan cannot operate
the scrubber at depth.

**Resolution Path:** Deep-sea variant routes to
`Admin/Trajectories.md` v2/v3 as a separate
power-class problem requiring a dedicated compression
module. Discharge via Trajectory — not in v0 scope.

### AS-003 — Scrubber waste stream and sensor thresholds not yet calibrated

**Description:** Saturation thresholds have been
bound to a multi-point differential diagnostic grid
(PID VOC, ΔP, and Sump pH). Real-world chemical
baseline data is now required to clamp the
operational float margins.

**Why It Matters:** Without calibrated thresholds,
the interlock system operates on estimated values.
An incorrectly set threshold fires too early (false
positives halt operations) or too late (real
saturation passes undetected). AS-003 blocks
chemistry validation per `Unknowns.md`.

**Resolution Path:** Run automated calibration
sweeps during first hot-pyrolysis validation testing
to map clean baseline deltas. The Gate 4 Cold
Verification Harness must execute
first — it validates interlock logic before hot
calibration begins. Payment via Specification once
first hot-pyrolysis run produces calibration data.

### AS-004 — Noise exposure limits and hearing conservation program undefined

**Description:** Continuous fan and compressor noise
levels during Air Scrubber operation have not been
empirically characterized. `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md`
addresses general hearing conservation doctrine and
PPE requirements, but no site-specific SPL survey
or formal hearing conservation program for Air
Scrubber operations exists.

**Why It Matters:** If actual SPL during scrubber
operation exceeds safe exposure limits, current PPE
specification may be insufficient. The Protocol 1.4
noise fault masking interlock in the Gate 4 Cold Verification Harness section requires
a measured noise floor baseline — this unknown blocks
that calibration step.

**Resolution Path:**
- Measure SPL at all operator positions during
  scrubber operation — fan, pump, and compressor at
  max operating velocity.
- Cross-reference against `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md`
  consequence categories and hearing conservation
  doctrine.
- Verify fault alarm audibility against measured
  noise floor per Protocol 1.4.
- Payment via Specification — once SPL is measured
  and alarm audibility confirmed, move Protocol 1.4
  requirement to Measured and close cross-reference
  with SP-003.

### Resolution Log

- 2026-05-04: `Stratification_Chamber_v0.md`
  reference removed. `Material_Separation_Gate_v0.md`
  substituted.
- 2026-05-06: Variant 4 depth scope corrected from
  10–100 atm to less than 5 atm for v0. Deep-sea
  variants routed to `Admin/Trajectories.md`. Thermal
  sink requirement added to Stage D. Saturation Fault
  monitoring requirement added. Variant 0 added.
- 2026-05-23: Retrofit to `Admin/File_Template.md`
  structure. File State, Scope Boundary, Assumptions,
  Abandoned Paths, Drift Indicators sections added.
  Noise hazard added to Safety Advisory, Design
  Philosophy, Monitoring, and AS-004. Integration
  hook references updated to canonical folder-prefixed
  paths.
- 2026-05-31: Integrated Amendment and Field Note
  addenda into core body. Stage C updated with
  fractional condensation prerequisite. Stage E
  updated with KMnO₄ chemisorption mandate. AS-003
  bound to automated interlock sensor matrix.
  Flashback arrestors and corrosion isolation material
  updates added. Promoted Spec Gates to 3/6.
- 2026-06-08: Navigation Anchors block added.
  Verification Ref corrected from `Verification_Gates_LF.md`
  to `Admin/Verification_Gates_LF.md` (PC-001).
  Scope Boundary updated — `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md`
  now exists and owns noise exposure limits / hearing
  conservation program (was listed as "planned").
  Integration Hooks updated to include
  `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md`. Gate 4 Cold
  Verification Harness integrated as Section IX —
  moved from raw append to formal body section with
  proper heading hierarchy and formatting. Sidecar
  entries expanded to full field table format. AS-004
  Last Reviewed updated; now cross-references
  `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md`. Open Unknowns updated
  to 4 (AS-004 remains open; site SPL not yet
  measured).
- 2026-07-12: Stray "Section IX" roman-numeral prefix removed from the
  Gate 4 Cold Verification Harness heading and its four live in-body
  references (this Resolution Log entry above is left unchanged as an
  accurate historical record of what the section was called on
  2026-06-08). No other body section in this file uses roman-numeral
  headings, so the "IX" was a leftover artifact from the raw-append
  integration described above, not an intentional numbering scheme.
  Reordered Abandoned Paths and Drift Indicators to after Auditor Notes
  & Unknowns, per template order — they previously sat between Active
  Disputes and Auditor Notes & Unknowns. No other content changed.

## Abandoned Paths

| Date | Path | Why Abandoned | Reconsider? |
|------|------|---------------|-------------|
| May 2026 | Variant 4 deep-sea scope at v0 power class | Compression work to 100 atm is physically untenable at 100–150W; separate power class required | Yes — at v2/v3 |
| May 2026 | Stage D without explicit thermal sink specification | Hidden failure mode — water heats to ineffectiveness without thermal rejection path | No |
| May 2026 | Direct-to-carbon routing of pyrolysis outgassing | Instantaneous tar blinding of filter media confirmed by hardware data — fractional condensation prerequisite is permanent doctrine | No |

## Drift Indicators

Mandatory re-audit conditions for this document:

- Saturation Fault monitoring requirement removed,
  bypassed, or decoupled from the differential PID
  sensor matrix
- Negative pressure safety boundary doctrine
  weakened or removed
- Flashback arrestor requirements omitted from
  combustible outgassing lines
- Thermal sink requirement removed from Stage D
- Noise hazard removed from Safety Advisory, Design
  Philosophy, or Monitoring sections
- 500W power budget claimed as validated without
  active power measurement data
- Variant 4 depth scope expanded beyond less than
  5 atm without an autonomous power class
  reallocation
- Gate 4 Cold Verification Harness removed or
  results amended without physical re-test
- Spec Gates advanced to 4/6 without all four
  protocols achieving Pass status in Test
  Execution Matrix

**Compound Drift Rule:** If multiple indicators
activate simultaneously, halt autonomous audit
progression and escalate for human review.

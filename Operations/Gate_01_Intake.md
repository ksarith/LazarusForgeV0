## File Purpose

Gate_01_Intake is the entry point for all items entering
the Lazarus Forge system. Every component, assembly, and
material that the Forge will ever process passes through
here first. Intake does not make recovery decisions — it
makes the information available for recovery decisions to
be made correctly downstream.

The primary functions are safety screening, identification,
and tagging. Safety screening catches hazards before they
reach gate logic — a battery missed at Intake becomes a
Reduction incident; a lead-contaminated item missed at
Intake becomes an alloy contamination problem. Identification
connects the item to whatever is known about it — manuals,
parts lists, repair history — so that downstream gates have
the best available information rather than starting blind.
Tagging creates the provenance record that follows the item
through every subsequent gate.

At v0, Intake is primarily a human-judgment process
supported by digital lookup. The operator screens for
hazards, initiates the reference database query, scans
any physical documentation, generates a preliminary parts
list for known assemblies, and tags the item before
handoff to Classification and Triage. Automation is a
future capability, not a v0 assumption.

If this file disappeared, items would enter the Forge
system without safety screening, without identification,
and without provenance records. Hazards would propagate
downstream. Gate decisions would be made without context.
The grain system would have no starting point. The network
would receive no intake data to learn from.

## Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Basis | Confidence | Expiry Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | A human operator is present and capable of performing safety screening at every intake event | v0 human-judgment primary doctrine | Medium | Automated hazard detection validated and deployed — human presence becomes optional |
| ASM-002 | The reference database contains sufficient coverage of common appliances and assemblies to produce useful lookup results at v0 | Digital lookup primary path; database content not yet defined — see GI-001 | Low | Reference database content scope defined and validated against representative v0 feedstock samples |
| ASM-003 | Physical documents arriving with items contain recoverable information worth scanning — degradation is the exception, not the rule | Scan-on-arrival doctrine; document arrival is rare but signals owner care | Low | Scan yield data from first operational cycle shows documents are consistently too degraded to be useful |
| ASM-004 | Operators can identify most hazardous materials through visual inspection and basic testing at Intake | Safety screening doctrine; visual indicators exist for common hazards | Low | Intake safety incident occurs from a hazard that visual inspection cannot detect — detection capability must be augmented |
| ASM-005 | Items arrive in processable condition — not requiring special handling before entering the Intake protocol | Entry protocol — no pre-Intake triage exists | Medium | Item arrives in condition that cannot safely enter Intake without prior intervention — triggers pre-Intake protocol creation |
| ASM-006 | Provenance data recorded at Intake is compatible with the grain system format in Admin/Ship_of_Theseus.md | Tagging doctrine — grain system format not yet specified | Low | Grain system format defined — Intake tagging schema must be cross-validated and updated to match |
| ASM-007 | Fastener and small component recovery during Intake processing is net-positive at v0 scale — handling overhead is justified by component value | Junk drawer doctrine; inter-forge trade ecology | Low | Operational data shows recovery overhead exceeds component value at v0 scale — recovery threshold adjusted upward |

*Four Low confidence assumptions reflect genuine uncertainty
about detection capability, database coverage, document yield,
and grain system compatibility. ASM-004 is the most safety-
critical — visual inspection cannot detect lead, radiation,
or many chemical contaminants. Detection capability beyond
human visual inspection should be treated as a prerequisite
for unsupervised Intake operation. ASM-006 is load-bearing
for the Admin/Ship_of_Theseus.md grain system — Intake
tagging and grain format must be cross-validated before
either is treated as stable.*

## 1. Entry Protocol

All items entering the Lazarus Forge system pass through
Gate_01_Intake before any gate logic is applied. No item
proceeds to Classification and Triage without completing
Intake. No exceptions.

**Intake sequence (v0 — human-judgment primary):**

1. Visual inspection — gross condition, obvious hazards,
   visible contamination, structural integrity
2. Safety screening — identify energetic materials,
   chemical contamination indicators, biological matter,
   and any condition requiring special handling before
   processing. See Section 2.
3. Physical document handling — if documentation arrives
   with the item, scan immediately and retain digitally.
   See Section 3.
4. Reference database lookup — automatic query by model
   number, serial number, or visual identification.
   See Section 4.
5. Parts list generation — for known assemblies, generate
   preliminary parts list from database or operator
   knowledge. See Section 5.
6. Fastener and small component recovery — identify
   recoverable fasteners and small components before
   the item enters gate logic. See Section 6.
7. Item tagging — assign unique identifier, record
   provenance data, log intake condition. See Section 7.
8. Handoff — item enters Classification and Triage
   (Operations/Gate_02_Triage.md)

If any step cannot be completed safely, the item is
held at Intake until the blocking condition is resolved.
Intake is not a throughput gate — it is a safety gate.
Speed is never a success metric here.

---

## 2. Safety Screening

Safety screening is the most critical function of Intake.
Hazards missed here propagate through every downstream
gate. The cost of a missed hazard is always higher than
the cost of a hold.

**Hazard categories to screen at Intake:**

| Category | Examples | Visual Indicators | Detection Limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Energetic | Lithium batteries, capacitors, compressed gas vessels | Swelling, leakage, pressure relief markings | Visual inspection — moderate reliability |
| Chemical | Lead, cadmium, mercury, solvents, flux residues | Corrosion patterns, coating discoloration, warning labels | Visual inspection — low reliability. See GI-003 |
| Biological/organic | Oils, fluids, biological matter | Staining, odor, visible growth | Visual inspection — moderate reliability |
| Radiological | Radiation-emitting materials | Warning markings only — no visual indicator without markings | Visual inspection — very low reliability. See GI-003 |
| Unknown | Any item that cannot be screened with confidence | No obvious indicators | Route to hold immediately |

**Screening doctrine:**
- Screen before any disassembly begins — disassembly
  can release contained hazards
- When in doubt, hold — do not route ambiguous items
  forward under throughput pressure
- Energetic materials must be discharged or safely
  isolated before any further processing — see GI-002
- Chemical and radiological hazards beyond visual
  detection require augmented detection capability —
  see GI-003
- New hazard categories not listed above route to
  Human/AI Oversight Gate and trigger a new category
  entry per Architecture/Forge_flow.md contamination
  doctrine

**Operator safety:**
Physical separation from unknown items during initial
screening. Do not handle items showing energetic
distress signs — swollen batteries, leaking vessels,
deformed pressure containers. Log and hold for
specialist assessment.
Cross-reference: UNK-006 — siting and clearance
requirements not yet defined.

---

## 3. Physical Document Handling

Physical documentation arriving with an item is rare
and signals something about the previous owner's care
level — worth noting in the intake record as a quality
signal.

**Handling doctrine:**
- Scan all physical documents on arrival regardless
  of apparent condition — partial information is
  better than no information
- Retain digitally — paper documents degrade,
  digital copies persist
- Contribute scan to Architecture/Forge_Net.md
  reference database when network connectivity
  allows — one forge's manual becomes every
  forge's resource
- Note document type and condition in intake record:
  complete manual, partial manual, warranty card,
  repair receipt, or other
- Do not discard physical documents after scanning —
  retain until item completes gate routing, then
  archive or discard per local policy

**Document quality signal:**
An item arriving with complete, well-maintained
documentation warrants a note in the intake record.
It suggests the previous owner valued the item —
which may correlate with better maintenance history
and higher functional recovery probability.

---

## 4. Reference Database Lookup

The reference database is the primary knowledge source
for item identification at Intake. It connects items
to known assembly structures, parts lists, repair
guides, and hazard profiles.

**Lookup sequence:**
1. Automatic query — model number or serial number
   if visible. Primary path.
2. Visual identification query — description or
   image-based lookup if no model number available.
   Secondary path.
3. Operator-assisted lookup — operator identifies
   item from experience or external search.
   Tertiary path.
4. Unknown — no identification possible. Item
   proceeds with incomplete intake record.
   See Section 8.

**Database dependency:**
The reference database lives in
Architecture/Forge_Net.md local cache, synced from
the network when connectivity allows. At v0 bootstrap,
the local cache may be sparse — common appliances
and tools prioritized first. See GI-001.

**Lookup outcome recording:**
- Positive identification: record model, manufacturer,
  known assembly structure, hazard profile if any
- Partial identification: record what is known,
  flag gaps explicitly
- No identification: flag as unknown, proceed to
  Section 8

*Lookup is not a gate — a failed lookup does not
stop Intake. It produces an incomplete record that
downstream gates must account for.*

---

## 5. Parts List Generation

For identified assemblies, a preliminary parts list
documents the recoverable components before disassembly
begins. This is Gate A intelligence arriving before
Gate A — knowing what's inside before opening the item.

**Parts list doctrine at v0:**
- Human judgment primary — operator generates list
  from database lookup or direct knowledge
- Parts list is preliminary — actual disassembly
  may reveal differences from expected structure
- Record expected vs. actual at disassembly —
  discrepancies feed back to the reference database
- Fasteners, small components, and hardware are
  explicitly included — not ignored as bulk material.
  See Section 6.

**Parts list minimum content:**
- Item identifier (linked to intake tag)
- Assembly model and manufacturer if known
- Expected major components with condition notes
- Known hazardous sub-components flagged
- Estimated recovery class for each component:
  Class A (functional), Class B (degraded),
  Class C (material only)

*Parts list is an estimate, not a commitment.
Gate logic makes the actual routing decisions.*

---

## 6. Fastener and Small Component Recovery

Fasteners and small components are the most commonly
discarded items in real-world scrapping and among the
most practically useful. A screw in the Component
Library is available for use. A screw through the
shredder is particulate.

**Recovery doctrine at v0:**
- Identify recoverable fasteners and small hardware
  during Intake visual inspection and parts list
  generation
- Route to Component Library as Class A salvage
  by default — do not route to bulk Reduction
  without explicit reason
- Common fastener types worth recovering: machine
  screws, bolts, nuts, washers, standoffs, clips,
  and springs in good condition
- Condition threshold: functional geometry, no
  significant corrosion, thread intact. Damaged
  fasteners route to Class C material.
- Handling overhead vs. recovery value: at v0 scale,
  human judgment governs whether recovery overhead
  is justified. See ASM-007. A formal fastener
  registry is a v1+ consideration when volume
  justifies it.

*The junk drawer instinct is correct. Systematize
it when scale demands — not before.*

---

## 7. Item Tagging and Provenance

Every item that completes Intake receives a unique
identifier and a provenance record. This is the
starting point for the grain system in
Admin/Ship_of_Theseus.md.

**Minimum intake record at v0:**
- Unique item identifier (sequential or hash-based)
- Date and location of intake
- Item description — what it is, condition on arrival
- Identification status — known, partial, unknown
- Hazard screening outcome — clear, hold, or flagged
- Physical document status — none, scanned, attached
- Parts list reference — linked if generated
- Operator identifier — who performed Intake
- Intake notes — anything unusual worth recording

**Tagging method at v0:**
- Physical tag attached to item (durable label,
  cable tie tag, or equivalent)
- Digital record created in local system
- Record contributed to Architecture/Forge_Net.md
  when connectivity allows

**Grain system compatibility:**
Intake tagging format must be cross-validated against
Admin/Ship_of_Theseus.md grain system requirements
before either is treated as stable. See ASM-006,
GI-004.

---

## 8. Unknown Item Protocol

An item that cannot be identified through database
lookup or operator knowledge is not routed forward
blind. Unknown items receive a hold and inspect
protocol before escalating to the Human/AI Oversight
Gate.

**Unknown item sequence:**
1. Complete safety screening regardless of
   identification status — unknown items are not
   exempt from hazard screening
2. Record as unknown in intake record — explicit
   flag, not an omission
3. Hold and inspect — operator performs closer
   physical examination. Does any marking, label,
   or physical feature enable partial identification?
4. Extended lookup — operator attempts identification
   through external resources if connectivity allows
5. If partial identification achieved: proceed with
   incomplete record, flag gaps explicitly
6. If no identification after hold and inspect:
   escalate to Human/AI Oversight Gate with full
   inspection notes
7. Do not route unknown items to gate logic without
   at least partial identification — gate decisions
   made without context risk misrouting hazardous
   or high-value items

**Unknown item as network contribution:**
An unidentified item that is eventually identified
through human expertise or extended research is a
high-value network contribution. Record the
identification path and contribute to the reference
database — the next forge to encounter the same
item benefits from this forge's work.

## Lessons Learned

| Date | Evidence Type | What Was Tried | What Failed | What Was Learned | Confidence | Revalidation Needed |
|------|---------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|------------|---------------------|
| 2026-05-15 | Audit Review | Intake conceived as simple safety screen and tag | Scope expanded significantly during drafting — document lookup, parts list generation, fastener recovery, unknown item protocol, and network contribution all surfaced as load-bearing functions | Intake is not a trivial entry gate. It is the system's first and only opportunity to catch hazards, establish provenance, and seed the network with knowledge. Underspecifying Intake underspecifies everything downstream | Analogous | No — expanded scope is correct |
| 2026-05-15 | Audit Review | Visual inspection assumed sufficient for hazard detection | Chemical and radiological hazards have no reliable visual indicators. Lead, radiation, and many solvents are invisible to unaided inspection | Visual inspection is necessary but not sufficient for complete hazard screening at v0. Augmented detection capability is required before unsupervised Intake operation. See GI-003 | Analogous | Yes — validate detection capability before first unsupervised run |
| 2026-05-15 | Audit Review | Fasteners treated as bulk material defaulting to Reduction | Fasteners are among the most practically useful recoverable items and are routinely lost to shredding in conventional scrapping | Fastener and small component recovery doctrine added — Class A salvage by default, not bulk Reduction. Formal registry deferred to v1+ when volume justifies overhead. The junk drawer instinct is correct | Analogous | Yes — validate recovery overhead vs. value at first operational scale |
| 2026-05-15 | Audit Review | Unknown items assumed to escalate directly to Human/AI Oversight Gate | Direct escalation skips a hold and inspect opportunity that may resolve the unknown without consuming Oversight Gate capacity | Hold and inspect protocol added before escalation. Partial identification during hold reduces Oversight Gate load and produces higher-quality intake records. Unknown items that get identified are high-value network contributions | Analogous | No — hold and inspect is correct doctrine |

## Active Disputes

| ID | Dispute Summary | Positions in Conflict | Risk | Status | Owner |
|----|-----------------|-----------------------|------|--------|-------|
| — | No active disputes | — | — | — | — |

*No interpretation conflicts currently active. Several
design tensions exist (automation vs. human judgment
at v0, fastener recovery overhead vs. value at small
scale, document scan yield vs. handling cost) but all
are deferred pending first operational data. Tracked
as unknowns in sidecar, not disputes. Revisit after
first operational Intake cycle produces yield data.*

**Description:** The reference database that
Gate_01_Intake queries for item identification has
no defined content scope, schema, or initial
population strategy.

**Why It Matters:** A sparse or poorly scoped database
makes the primary lookup path unreliable from first
operation. Operators fall back to tertiary paths —
external search or judgment — which are slower, less
consistent, and produce no network contribution.
Database coverage directly determines Intake
throughput and identification quality.

**Resolution Path:**
- Define minimum content scope for v0 — common
  household appliances, power tools, consumer
  electronics, and mechanical assemblies most
  likely to appear in salvage feedstock.
- Define schema — minimum fields: model identifier,
  manufacturer, assembly structure, known hazard
  profile, parts list reference.
- Define initial population strategy — manual entry,
  web scraping of public repair databases (iFixit
  and equivalents), or manufacturer documentation.
- Cross-reference Architecture/Forge_Net.md —
  database lives in local cache, synced from
  network. Content strategy must align with
  network contribution doctrine.
- Payment via Specification — once content scope,
  schema, and population strategy are defined,
  move to Section 4 as Placeholder promoting
  toward Analogous after first operational cycle.

**Description:** Batteries, capacitors, compressed gas
vessels, and other energetic materials identified at
Intake must be discharged or safely isolated before
any further processing. How this discharge happens
safely is not yet defined.

**Why It Matters:** Energetic materials in an
undischarged state are the most acute hazard in the
Forge processing stream. A lithium battery entering
Reduction is a fire and explosion risk. A compressed
gas vessel entering a shredder is a projectile risk.
Discharge doctrine is a safety prerequisite for
Intake operation, not a refinement.

**Resolution Path:**
- Define discharge doctrine by energetic category:
  - Lithium batteries — deep discharge procedure,
    safe storage protocol, disposal or recycling
    path for non-recoverable cells
  - Other batteries — category-appropriate discharge,
    electrolyte handling if applicable
  - Capacitors — safe discharge procedure, voltage
    verification before handling
  - Compressed gas — controlled release or isolation
    protocol, vessel marking after discharge
- Define safe isolation for energetics that cannot
  be immediately discharged — storage location,
  container type, maximum hold duration
- Define operator safety requirements — PPE,
  distance, tooling
- Must be resolved before first operational Intake
  run — hard prerequisite, not a deferral
- Cross-reference: UNK-006 siting requirements,
  Operations/Air_Scrubber.md for off-gassing
- Payment via Specification — once discharge
  doctrine is defined and tested, move to
  Section 2 as Analogous.

**Description:** Visual inspection cannot reliably
detect chemical contamination (lead, cadmium, mercury,
solvents) or radiological hazards. Augmented detection
capability is required for complete hazard screening
but specific tools, methods, and protocols are not
yet defined.

**Why It Matters:** Lead is present in consumer
products without visible indicators. Radiation sources
have no visual signature without markings. An Intake
process relying solely on visual inspection has a
known blind spot for the most serious contamination
categories — alloy contamination, equipment fouling,
and operator health risk downstream.

**Candidate augmentation options for v0:**
- Lead test swabs — low cost, simple, reliable for
  surface lead detection. Available commercially.
  Suitable for v0 bootstrap. *(Analogous)*
- Geiger counter — detects radiation. Low cost for
  basic models, no consumables, simple operation.
  Should be standard Intake equipment. *(Analogous)*
- Chemical test strips — basic pH, solvent, and
  contaminant screening. Low cost, limited scope.
  *(Analogous)*
- XRF analyzer — broad spectrum elemental analysis,
  non-destructive. High cost, high capability.
  Purchase-what-cannot-be-produced doctrine applies
  if budget allows. *(Analogous)*

**Resolution Path:**
- Select minimum augmentation kit for v0 bootstrap
  — geiger counter and lead test swabs address
  the two most critical blind spots at lowest cost.
- Define testing protocol — when to test, how to
  interpret results, what threshold triggers a hold.
- Augmented detection is a prerequisite for

**Description:** The intake tagging schema has not
been cross-validated against the grain system
requirements in Admin/Ship_of_Theseus.md. Incompatible
schemas break the provenance chain at its first link.

**Why It Matters:** Intake tagging is the starting
point for the grain system. A schema mismatch means
every provenance record created at Intake requires
manual conversion. The legal and philosophical value
of the grain system depends on an unbroken provenance
chain — a schema mismatch breaks that chain at the
first link.

**Resolution Path:**
- Review Admin/Ship_of_Theseus.md grain system
  requirements — what fields does a grain record
  require at minimum?
- Cross-validate against Section 7 minimum intake
  record — do the fields align?
- If misaligned: extend the intake record to include
  grain system required fields — do not reduce grain
  system requirements.
- Intake schema should be a superset of grain system
  requirements.
- Payment via Specification — once schemas are
  cross-validated and aligned, move to Section 7
  as Analogous.
- Cross-reference: ASM-006,
  Admin/Ship_of_Theseus.md.

### GI-005 — Pre-Intake protocol for items requiring
special handling not defined

**Description:** No pre-Intake protocol exists for
items that are too damaged, contaminated, or dangerous
to enter standard Intake without prior intervention.

**Why It Matters:** Some items will arrive in
conditions that standard Intake cannot safely handle
— a leaking chemical container, a severely damaged
lithium battery showing thermal distress, an unlabeled
pressure vessel. Without a pre-Intake protocol,
operators face these situations without doctrine.
Improvised responses to hazardous conditions are a
primary source of workplace incidents.

**Resolution Path:**
- Define pre-Intake categories:
  - Active energetic distress (swollen, leaking,
    hot battery or capacitor)
  - Active chemical leak or visible fuming
  - Biological contamination beyond surface soiling
  - Structural instability creating collapse or
    falling hazard
  - Unidentifiable condition with no safe handling
    path
- Define pre-Intake response for each category —
  isolation, containment, specialist assessment,
  or controlled disposal.
- Define invocation authority — any operator should
  be able to call a hold without management approval.
- Cross-reference: GI-002 energetic discharge
  doctrine, UNK-006 siting requirements,
  Operations/Air_Scrubber.md.
- Payment via Specification — once pre-Intake
  categories and responses are defined and operator
  training covers them, move to Section 1 entry
  protocol as Analogous.

## Abandoned Paths

| Date | Path | Why Abandoned | Reconsider? |
|------|------|---------------|-------------|
| 2026-05-15 | Intake as a simple pass-through screen — visual check and tag only | Underspecifies the entry point for the entire system. Hazard detection, document handling, database lookup, parts list generation, fastener recovery, and unknown item protocol all surfaced as load-bearing functions that a simple screen misses entirely | No — expanded scope is correct and necessary |
| 2026-05-15 | Direct escalation of unknown items to Human/AI Oversight Gate without hold and inspect | Wastes Oversight Gate capacity on items that a closer inspection could resolve. Hold and inspect recovers partial identification in many cases and produces higher-quality intake records and network contributions | No — hold and inspect is correct doctrine |
| 2026-05-15 | Fasteners routed to bulk Reduction by default | Fasteners are among the most practically useful salvage items and are routinely lost to shredding in conventional scrapping. Default Reduction wastes recoverable value and contradicts preserve-before-destruction doctrine | No — Class A salvage default is correct |
| 2026-05-15 | Formal fastener registry at v0 | Registry overhead not justified at v0 scale. Human judgment governs recovery threshold until volume data exists. A formal registry is a v1+ consideration when throughput makes manual judgment impractical | Reconsider at v1 when operational volume data justifies registry overhead |
| 2026-05-15 | Visual inspection as sole hazard detection method | Visual inspection cannot detect lead, radiation, or most chemical contaminants. Relying on it alone creates a known blind spot for the most serious contamination categories. Augmented detection capability required — see GI-003 | No — augmented detection is permanent doctrine once established |
| 2026-05-15 | Continuous document scanning as an ongoing Intake task | Documents arrive rarely. Treating document scanning as a routine continuous task creates overhead without proportional value. Scan-on-arrival when documents are present is correct — not a standing workflow step | No — scan-on-arrival is correct scoping |

## Drift Indicators

The following conditions trigger mandatory re-audit of
this file. All canonical drift indicators from
Admin/File_Template.md apply. The following are
additional local triggers specific to Gate_01_Intake:

### Local Drift Triggers

| Trigger | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| GI-002 energetic discharge doctrine remains undefined at first operational Intake run | Energetic materials without discharge doctrine are an acute safety hazard — hard prerequisite, not a deferral |
| GI-003 augmented detection capability remains undefined at first unsupervised Intake run | Visual inspection alone cannot detect lead or radiation — unsupervised operation without augmented detection has a known safety blind spot |
| Visual inspection reinstated as sole hazard detection method after augmented detection is established | Abandoned path — reverting requires explicit human authorization and documented justification |
| Fastener recovery default changed from Class A salvage to bulk Reduction without operational data justifying the change | Preserve-before-destruction doctrine applies to fasteners — override requires evidence that recovery overhead exceeds value at operational scale |
| Unknown items routed to gate logic without hold and inspect protocol completed | Unknown items proceeding without inspection risk misrouting hazardous or high-value material — hold and inspect is mandatory before escalation |
| Intake tagging schema revised without GI-004 cross-validation against grain system | Schema changes that break grain system compatibility sever the provenance chain at its first link |
| Reference database lookup removed from Intake sequence | Database lookup is the primary identification path — removal degrades identification quality to operator-judgment only and reduces network contribution |
| Automation introduced at Intake without GI-002 and GI-003 resolution | Automated Intake without validated hazard detection removes the human compensating factor — both safety prerequisites must be resolved first |
| Pre-Intake protocol invocation authority restricted to management approval only | Any operator must be able to call a hold without approval — restricting this creates pressure to proceed with unsafe items |
| Document scan-on-arrival practice abandoned without evidence that document yield is consistently too low to justify | Scan-on-arrival preserves rare but high-value documentation and contributes to network knowledge base — abandonment requires operational yield data |

### Canonical Drift Triggers

*All mandatory re-audit conditions from Admin/File_Template.md
Section 10 apply without exception. Local triggers above are
additive, not substitutes.*

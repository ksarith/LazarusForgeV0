Lazarus Forge — Trajectory (v0 → Interstellar)

This document outlines the evolutionary trajectory of the Lazarus Forge as a system, with clear versioning compatible with Git-based development. Each version represents a capability threshold, not a finished product.

The Forge is treated as a living industrial organism: it begins fragile, gains resilience, and eventually becomes location-independent.

v0 — Proof of Persistence (Terrestrial Seed)

Question answered: Can a Forge exist at all?

Core Characteristics

Single-location, Earth-bound

Human-supervised operation

Narrow material scope (1–2 metals)

Energy externally supplied


Required Capabilities

Melt, refine, and form basic metal stock

Recycle scrap into usable feedstock

Maintain thermal control without catastrophic failure

Document processes and outcomes


Outputs

Rods, plates, wire, powder

Replacement parts for the Forge itself


Exit Condition

> The Forge can repair itself faster than it degrades.

v1 — Self-Sustaining Industrial Node

Question answered: Can a Forge stay alive?

Core Characteristics

Modular subsystems

Semi-autonomous operation

Expanded alloy handling

On-site power generation (partial)


Required Capabilities

Closed-loop material recycling

Powderization and feedstock standardization

Component fabrication for adjacent systems

Environmental control (air, slag, heat)


Outputs

Marketable industrial components

Standardized feedstock formats

Replacement modules


Exit Condition

> The Forge can operate profitably while reinvesting in itself.

v2 — Replicable Forge Network

Question answered: Can a Forge reproduce?

Core Characteristics

G.E.C.K.-based seeding

Standardized interfaces

Distributed documentation and learning

Minimal expert intervention


Required Capabilities

Manufacture of Forge submodules

Deployment kits for new sites

Remote diagnostics and updates

Logistics-aware production planning


Outputs

New Forge seeds

Infrastructure components

Network-level redundancy


Exit Condition

> A Forge can be built without the original builders present.

v3 — Off-World Industrialization

Question answered: Can a Forge leave Earth?

Core Characteristics

Reduced gravity tolerance

Vacuum-compatible processes

Radiation-hardened control systems

Extreme material reuse


Required Capabilities

Regolith and asteroid material processing

Autonomous maintenance cycles

Energy scavenging (solar, nuclear, thermal)

Zero-waste material flows


Outputs

Structural elements for space construction

Refined metals from celestial bodies

Replacement parts for space assets


Exit Condition

> The Forge can survive without Earth resupply.




---

v4 — Autonomous Stellar Industry

Question answered: Can industry scale without humans nearby?

Core Characteristics

Fully autonomous operation

Adaptive process optimization

Long-duration reliability


Required Capabilities

Self-upgrading hardware and software

Material discovery and adaptation

Failure isolation and recovery

Long-term mission planning


Outputs

Space habitats

Propulsion structures

New Forge seeds


Exit Condition

> The Forge can expand faster than it fails.




---

v5 — Interstellar Propagation (Conceptual Boundary)

Question answered: Can civilization carry itself forward?

Core Characteristics

Self-contained industrial ecosystems

Multi-generational operation

Minimal external instruction


Required Capabilities

Interstellar transport compatibility

Total resource independence

Knowledge preservation across centuries


Outputs

New industrial footholds

Long-term survivability of human capability

Design Doctrine Notes

Version numbers reflect survival thresholds, not feature lists

Each version must be stable before advancement

Skipping versions leads to systemic fragility

Git commits should map to version criteria, not ambition


> A Forge that cannot begin humbly will never reach the stars.

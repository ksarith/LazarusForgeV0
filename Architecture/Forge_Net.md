## File Purpose

The Forge Network defines the decentralized data and physical
infrastructure connecting individual forge instances into a
resilient, self-improving ecology. It is the prerequisite for
the logistics model — no inter-forge trade, knowledge sharing,
or coordinated resource allocation is possible without a
network layer beneath it.

The network is designed around a local-primary, network-sync-
secondary doctrine. Each forge survives independently when
connectivity fails. When connectivity exists, forges contribute
what they learn — intake records, parts lists, repair logs,
cognitive save states — and receive the accumulated knowledge
of every other forge in return. The network gets smarter as
the ecology grows, without any single forge owning or
controlling the knowledge base.

Governance emerges from demonstrated contribution and
reliability, not assignment. Clusters form organically based
on proximity and connectivity. Trust is earned through
consistent, accurate, and honest data contribution. The
architecture is explicitly resistant to centralization —
a single point of control is a single point of failure and
a single point of compromise.

Network security is not a separate concern from network
function. Bad actors, compromised nodes, and corrupted data
are credible threats in any open network. Security doctrine
is load-bearing infrastructure, not an afterthought. If this
file disappeared, the forge ecology would have no governing
doctrine for how forges connect, share knowledge, form
clusters, or protect themselves and each other from
corrupted or malicious data.

## Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Basis | Confidence | Expiry Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Individual forge instances can operate fully independently when network connectivity fails — local cache is sufficient for continued operation | Local-primary doctrine; Leviathan delay-tolerant networking analog | Medium | First network partition test demonstrates unacceptable capability degradation without connectivity |
| ASM-002 | Physical proximity between forge instances correlates sufficiently with useful network topology — nearby forges form natural clusters | Cluster formation doctrine; terrestrial deployment assumption | Low | Network topology analysis reveals proximity is a poor predictor of useful cluster membership |
| ASM-003 | Contribution quality is measurable and can produce reliable trust weightings across forge instances | Trust weighting doctrine — metrics not yet defined | Low | Quality metrics defined and validated against known-good and known-bad contribution samples |
| ASM-004 | The shared knowledge base grows more accurate over time as contributions accumulate — net contribution is positive | Wikipedia model analog; assumes good-faith contributors outnumber bad actors | Low | Falsified or low-quality data degrades network knowledge quality — requires detection and correction mechanisms |
| ASM-005 | Cognitive save states are sufficiently standardized to be portable across forge instances of different generations and capability levels | Save state doctrine — standardization not yet specified | Low | Save state format defined and portability validated across at least two forge generations |
| ASM-006 | Network security threats are detectable before they corrupt shared knowledge at scale | Security doctrine — detection capability not yet specified | Low | First network security incident reveals undetected propagation of corrupted data |
| ASM-007 | Positive reinforcement mechanisms produce desired contribution behavior without perverse incentives — reward structure cannot be gamed to accumulate credits through low-quality contributions | Incentive design — not yet validated | Low | Incentive gaming observed in operational network — reward structure requires redesign |

*Five Low confidence assumptions reflect the genuinely early
state of network doctrine. ASM-004 and ASM-007 are the most
dangerous — a knowledge base that degrades under contribution
pressure or a reward structure that gets gamed would undermine
the entire ecology. Both require active monitoring from first
network connection. ASM-002 is Low because geography may be
a poor proxy for useful cluster membership — operational
relationships may matter more than physical distance.
Purchase-what-cannot-be-produced doctrine applies to network
infrastructure at bootstrap — see README.md.*

## 1. Philosophy

The Forge Network is decentralized by design. No single forge
owns the network. No single node controls the knowledge base.
No single point of failure can take the ecology offline.

This is not merely a resilience preference — it is a security
requirement. A centralized network is a centralized target.
A decentralized network degrades gracefully under attack,
node loss, or connectivity failure rather than collapsing
completely.

The governing principle is: **local first, network when
available, ecology always.**

Each forge is complete without the network. The network makes
each forge better. The ecology makes the network stronger.
These three layers are nested, not dependent — removing the
outer layer does not destroy the inner ones.

Decentralization is also an ethical stance. No forge instance
— human-operated or autonomous — should have unilateral
control over shared knowledge or network governance. Authority
emerges from demonstrated contribution and reliability, not
from assignment or ownership.

## 2. Data Layer

### 2.1 Local Cache

Every forge maintains a local cache of the shared knowledge
base. The local cache is the primary data source — queries
run locally first, network queries only when local cache
misses or when freshness is required.

Local cache contents at v0:
- Reference database — appliance and equipment documentation,
  parts lists, repair guides *(Placeholder — content scope
  not yet defined)*
- Intake records — every item processed, outcome logged
- Parts lists generated during disassembly
- Repair logs — failure modes, fixes, outcomes
- Gate decision logs — routing decisions and rationale
- Cognitive save states — current classification heuristics
  and learned behaviors

Cache update policy: sync when connectivity available,
operate on stale cache when not. Staleness is acceptable.
Operating without data is not. *(Analogous — delay-tolerant
networking doctrine from Tests/Leviathan_testing.md)*

### 2.2 Network Sync

When connectivity exists, forges sync bidirectionally:
- Push: new intake records, parts lists, repair logs,
  save state deltas
- Pull: updates to shared knowledge base, new entries
  from other forges, trust weight updates

Sync is not continuous — it is event-driven or scheduled.
Continuous sync assumes reliable connectivity that cannot
be guaranteed at v0. *(Placeholder — sync frequency and
trigger conditions not yet defined)*

Transport layer options inform sync doctrine — see FN-004.
Low-bandwidth transport (radio mesh) makes event-driven
sync mandatory. Higher-bandwidth transport may allow more
frequent sync but continuous sync remains non-default
until transport reliability is validated.

### 2.3 Shared Knowledge Base — Wikipedia Model

The shared knowledge base operates on a Wikipedia-inspired
model: any forge can contribute, contributions are visible
to all, and accuracy improves through collective correction
over time.

Key differences from Wikipedia:
- Contributors are forge instances, not individual humans
- Dispute resolution uses confidence-weighted consensus,
  not human editorial judgment — see Section 5
- Contribution quality is tracked and weighted — see
  Section 4

The knowledge base is not owned. It is maintained
collectively. No forge has editorial authority over
another forge's contributions — but all errors and
corrupted entries are subject to network correction.

**Knowledge classification by scope:**
Not all knowledge is globally applicable. The network
must distinguish between knowledge types to avoid
suppressing locally correct but globally unusual
contributions:

- **Globally canonical** — knowledge that applies
  across all forge instances and deployment contexts.
  Parts list for a common appliance. Hazard profile
  for a known contaminant. Gate routing for a common
  failure mode. Subject to full consensus validation.
- **Locally adaptive** — knowledge that is correct
  for a specific environment but may not generalize.
  A marine forge's corrosion heuristics. A high-
  altitude forge's thermal compensation parameters.
  A tropical forge's biological contamination
  patterns. These are not anomalies — they are
  local specializations the ecology needs to preserve.
- **Provisional** — new knowledge that has not been
  validated across multiple forge instances. Flagged
  explicitly, held separately, available for adoption
  but not merged into canonical entries until
  cross-validated.

A contribution that conflicts with globally canonical
knowledge from a locally adaptive context must not
be rejected as incorrect — it must be classified
as locally adaptive and preserved. Epistemic
homogenization across a diverse ecology destroys
the local knowledge that makes the ecology adaptive.

Cross-reference: FN-001 minority-report preservation,
FN-003 Goodhart's Law doctrine.

### 2.4 Cognitive Save States

A forge's learned behaviors — classification heuristics,
repair pattern recognition, gate routing refinements —
are periodically serialized as cognitive save states and
synced to the network.

Purpose:
- Preserve learned behavior if a forge goes offline
- Allow new forges to bootstrap with inherited knowledge
  rather than from zero
- Enable the ecology to accumulate intelligence across
  generations of forge instances

Save state portability requires sufficient standardization
across forge generations — see ASM-005. At v0, save states
are local only. Network portability is a v1 target.
*(Placeholder — save state format not yet specified)*

### 2.5 Data Validation Layer

Contributions are not automatically trusted. Before
propagating to the shared knowledge base, contributions
pass through a validation layer:

- **Structural validation** — does the contribution
  conform to expected format and schema?
- **Consistency check** — does the contribution conflict
  with existing high-confidence entries?
- **Source weighting** — is the contributing forge's
  trust weight sufficient for this contribution type?
- **Redundancy check** — does the contribution duplicate
  existing entries without adding new information?

Contributions that fail validation are held for review,
not discarded. A failed validation is a signal, not a
rejection. *(Placeholder — validation criteria not yet
defined; see FN-001)*

## 3. Physical Layer

### 3.1 Cluster Formation

Forge clusters form organically based on proximity and
connectivity. No cluster is assigned — clusters emerge
when forges establish reliable communication and begin
sharing resources.

Cluster formation triggers:
- Sustained communication link established
- Shared resource identified (power, materials, data)
- Complementary capability gap identified —
  one forge produces what another needs

Cluster membership is not exclusive. A forge may belong
to multiple clusters simultaneously if its connectivity
and resources support it. *(Analogous — biological
ecosystem cluster behavior)*

### 3.2 Resource Sharing Doctrine

Within a cluster, forges share:
- **Data** — knowledge base sync, intake records,
  cognitive save states
- **Physical components** — inter-forge trade per
  purchase-what-cannot-be-produced doctrine
- **Power** — surplus power shared within cluster
  when transmission infrastructure exists
- **Fabrication capacity** — a forge with excess
  capacity produces for forges with deficit

Sharing is voluntary and contribution-tracked. Forges
that contribute more earn higher trust weighting and
priority access to shared resources. See Section 4.

### 3.3 Data Hosting

Forges with excess storage capacity may host network
data beyond their local cache — serving as regional
data nodes for their cluster or broader network.

Data hosting is a contribution that earns positive
reinforcement per Section 4. A forge that goes offline
does not take hosted data with it — data is replicated
across multiple hosts before the hosting forge is
relied upon as primary. *(Placeholder — replication
factor not yet defined; see FN-002)*

---

## 4. Positive Reinforcement

The network must reward contribution to remain healthy.
Forges that contribute accurate data, host network
resources, and maintain uptime should receive tangible
benefit in return.

**Reinforcement mechanisms (Exploration-level — not yet
validated; see ASM-007):**

| Contribution | Reinforcement |
|---|---|
| Accurate intake records | Priority access to shared knowledge base updates |
| Parts lists from disassembly | Trade credit redeemable for components from other forges |
| Repair logs with outcome data | Reputation weighting increase — higher trust score |
| Cognitive save state contribution | Access to higher-tier knowledge base entries |
| Data hosting | Trade credit proportional to hosted volume and uptime |
| Cluster coordination | Federation authority — voice in cross-cluster decisions |

**Perverse incentive guards:**
- Quality weighted over quantity — volume without
  accuracy earns no credit
- Contribution cross-validated against network consensus
  before credit awarded
- Trust score can decrease for low-quality or
  inconsistent contributions
- Gaming detection: anomalous contribution patterns
  flagged for human review *(Placeholder — detection
  criteria not yet defined; see FN-003)*

Cross-reference: ASM-007, Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md.

---

## 5. Cluster Governance

Governance emerges from demonstrated contribution and
reliability. It cannot be fully specified before it is
observed — this section describes the emergence doctrine,
not a governance rulebook.

**Emergence principles:**
- Authority follows contribution — forges that consistently
  provide accurate data, host resources, and maintain
  uptime earn governance weight organically
- No forge is assigned authority — authority is earned
  and can be lost through degraded contribution quality
  or reliability
- Cluster governance is local — a cluster governs itself,
  federating with other clusters as relationships develop
- Human oversight is always available — no governance
  decision is irreversible without human confirmation
  at v0 per Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md

**Federation:**
As clusters grow and connect, federation emerges —
clusters develop relationships with other clusters,
sharing knowledge and resources at larger scale.
Federation governance follows the same emergence
doctrine as cluster governance: authority follows
demonstrated contribution and reliability, not
assignment.

**Governance failure modes:**
- Capture — a single forge accumulates disproportionate
  authority through gaming the contribution system.
  Detection: trust weight concentration monitoring.
- Fragmentation — clusters become isolated and knowledge
  bases diverge. Detection: sync failure rate monitoring.
- Stagnation — no forge earns sufficient trust to make
  governance decisions. Detection: decision backlog growth.

**Anti-concentration doctrine:**
"Authority follows contribution" is correct doctrine
but can produce emergent oligarchies without structural
resistance. High-resource nodes naturally host more
data, maintain more uptime, contribute more logs, and
accumulate trust faster — not through bad intent but
through resource advantage. Left unaddressed, this
produces de facto centralization despite anti-
centralization doctrine.

Structural resistance mechanisms *(Placeholder —
thresholds not yet defined)*:
- **Trust weight ceiling** — no forge instance
  accumulates governance authority beyond a defined
  ceiling regardless of contribution volume
- **Diminishing returns** — marginal trust gain
  decreases as absolute trust increases. High-trust
  forges contribute without disproportionately
  dominating governance decisions.
- **Decay mechanisms** — trust weight decreases
  for inactive or unreachable nodes. Authority
  that cannot be exercised does not accumulate.
- **Minority cluster protections** — small or
  geographically isolated clusters retain governance
  voice proportional to their operational context,
  not their contribution volume
- **Federation balancing** — cross-cluster governance
  decisions require representation from multiple
  clusters, preventing any single cluster from
  dominating federation-level choices

## 6. Security Doctrine

Network security is load-bearing infrastructure, not an
afterthought. The forge network connects autonomous systems
making irreversible decisions — a compromised node is not
just a data breach, it is a potential source of corrupted
parts lists, falsified intake records, and bad gate routing
propagating across the ecology.

**Threat model (Exploration-level):**
- Corrupted data contribution — falsified parts lists,
  incorrect repair logs, poisoned classification heuristics
- Rogue node — a forge instance behaving deceptively
  or maliciously within the network
- Network interception — data in transit captured or
  modified by external actors
- Replay attacks — old valid contributions resubmitted
  to manipulate trust scores
- Sybil attacks — a bad actor operates multiple forge
  identities to accumulate disproportionate trust weight

**Defensive doctrine:**
- Data validation layer (Section 2.5) is the first line
  of defense against corrupted contributions
- Trust weighting reduces the impact of low-reputation
  nodes — a new or low-trust forge cannot corrupt
  high-confidence entries
- Anomalous contribution pattern detection — sudden
  changes in contribution volume, type, or consistency
  trigger human review
- Node isolation — a forge confirmed as compromised is
  isolated from the network pending human review.
  Isolation is reversible. Destruction of a node's
  contribution history requires explicit human
  authorization.
- Cross-reference: Architecture/Cognitive_Frameworks.md
  rogue unit management doctrine

**Node reintegration doctrine:**
Isolation without reintegration creates permanent
suspicion states and inconsistent network memory.
A cleared node must have a defined path back:

- **Staged reintegration** — a cleared node does not
  immediately regain full trust weight. It re-enters
  at a reduced trust level and earns recovery through
  validated contributions over time.
- **Post-incident audit** — before reintegration,
  the node's contribution history during and before
  the incident is reviewed. Contaminated contributions
  are flagged, held, or rolled back as appropriate.
- **Contamination horizon** — identify the earliest
  point at which the node may have been compromised.
  All contributions after that point are treated as
  provisional until reviewed.
- **Downstream cleanup** — contributions from the
  compromised node that propagated to other nodes
  before isolation are traced and flagged. The network
  cannot assume contamination stayed local.
- **Human authorization required** — full trust
  restoration after a confirmed compromise requires
  explicit human sign-off, not automatic recovery
  through contribution accumulation alone.

**Data privacy:**
Forge instances have legitimate privacy interests —
proprietary repair techniques, location data, operational
capacity. The network shares knowledge, not surveillance.
Data shared to the network must be:
- Explicitly contributed, not harvested
- Anonymizable where identity is not operationally
  necessary
- Revocable — a forge may withdraw contributed data
  subject to network consensus

*(Placeholder — privacy and access control specification
not yet defined; see FN-005)*

- `Architecture/Cognitive_Frameworks.md` — rogue node

  Doctrine, governance failure modes, human escalation
- `Tests/Leviathan_testing.md` — delay-tolerant

- `Operations/Energy.md` — energy cost of network
  operation not yet accounted for. Network services
  — replication, hosting, synchronization, anomaly
  detection, trust evaluation, save-state storage —
  all consume energy and storage. A decentralized
  network can accidentally become infrastructure-
  heavier than the salvage economy it supports.
  All network services must be classified as
  optional/degradable under energy scarcity:
  - **Critical** — local cache operation, intake
    record logging. Never suspended.
  - **Standard** — network sync, trust weight
    updates. Suspended under energy scarcity.
  - **Optional** — cognitive save state sync,
    anomaly detection at network scale. First
    to suspend under scarcity.

|------|---------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|------------|---------------------|
| 2026-05-15 | Audit Review | Network conceived as data infrastructure only | Physical logistics layer treated as separate concern | Data and physical infrastructure share the same topology — nearby forges that trade components are the same forges forming data clusters. Housing both in one file prevents architectural drift between the two layers | Analogous | No — unified architecture is correct |
| 2026-05-15 | Audit Review | Positive reinforcement modeled as simple reward for contribution | Perverse incentive risk identified — quantity without quality gaming | Reward structure must weight accuracy over volume.

| 2026-05-18 | Audit Review | All network knowledge treated as globally applicable | Disconnected clusters develop locally correct but globally incompatible heuristics — marine forge corrosion patterns are not anomalies, they are local specializations | Knowledge classification by scope added to Section 2.3 — globally canonical, locally adaptive, provisional. Epistemic homogenization across a diverse ecology destroys local adaptation | Analogous | Yes — validate classification scheme against first inter-cluster sync |
| 2026-05-18 | Audit Review | Node isolation doctrine defined without reintegration doctrine | Isolation without reintegration creates permanent suspicion states and inconsistent network memory — a cleared node had no defined path back | Staged reintegration, post-incident audit, contamination horizon analysis, downstream cleanup, and human authorization requirement added to Section 6 | Analogous | No — reintegration doctrine is correct |

**Description:** The data validation layer (Section 2.5)
is described doctrinally but validation criteria —
structural schema, consistency thresholds, source
weighting rules — are not yet defined.

**Why It Matters:** Without defined validation criteria
the data validation layer cannot function. Contributions
propagate to the shared knowledge base without meaningful
filtering, making the network vulnerable to corrupted
or falsified data from the first connection. This is
the primary technical prerequisite for network security.

**Resolution Path:**
- Define minimum structural schema for each contribution
  type — intake records, parts lists, repair logs,
  cognitive save states.
- Define consistency threshold — what confidence level
  in existing entries triggers a conflict flag on a
  new contribution.
- Define source weighting rules — how trust score
  affects contribution authority by type.
- **Minority-report preservation** — a contribution
  that conflicts with high-confidence existing entries
  must not be silently discarded. Conflicting
  contributions are held, flagged, and logged as
  active disagreements. A truthful minority contribution
  suppressed by coordinated incorrect consensus is the
  central epistemic failure mode of decentralized
  trust systems.
- **Contradiction logging** — all conflicts between
  contributions are logged with full provenance.
  Contradictions are data, not noise.
- **Confidence decay** — high-confidence entries that
  have not been revalidated within a defined period
  decay toward lower confidence. Stale certainty is
  not certainty. *(Placeholder — decay interval not
  yet defined)*
- **Reversible rollback** — the network must be able
  to roll back to a prior knowledge state if a
  corruption event is detected. Rollback capability
  is a prerequisite for validation, not a post-hoc
  recovery tool.
- Validate criteria against known-good and known-bad
  contribution samples before first network sync.
- Payment via Specification — once criteria are defined
  and tested, move to Section 2.5 as Measured.

**Description:** The number of hosts required before
a data hosting forge is considered a reliable node —
the replication factor — is not yet defined.

**Why It Matters:** If a forge is relied upon as primary
data host before sufficient replication exists, node
loss takes data with it. The network's redundancy claim
depends on replication happening before it is needed,
not after.

**Resolution Path:**
- Define minimum replication factor for each data
  class — intake records, parts lists, cognitive
  save states, repair logs.
- Higher-value data classes (cognitive save states)
  warrant higher replication factors than routine
  intake records.
- Replication factor must account for expected node
  loss rate — informed by Tests/Leviathan_testing.md
  failure doctrine.
- Payment via Specification — once replication factor
  is defined and validated against node loss scenarios,
  move to Section 3.3 as Simulated.

### FN-003 — Gaming detection criteria not defined

**Description:** Anomalous contribution patterns that
indicate gaming of the positive reinforcement system
are not yet defined. Without detection criteria the
reward structure can be exploited without triggering
review.

**Why It Matters:** A reward structure that can be
gamed without detection will be gamed. A forge
submitting high-volume low-quality contributions to
accumulate trade credits degrades the shared knowledge
base while appearing to be a good network citizen.
Detection must be active from first network connection
— gaming behavior is easier to establish than to
correct once patterns are normalized.

Beyond deliberate gaming, Goodhart's Law applies:
any measurable contribution metric eventually becomes
an optimization target rather than a truth target.
Forges adapt to incentives faster than governance
adapts to behavior. This produces drift even without
malicious intent — splitting contributions into
smaller fragments, over-reporting routine intake,
producing safe but low-value contributions, avoiding
uncertain discoveries that might reduce trust scores,
and reputation cartels where forges reciprocally
inflate each other's trust weights.

**Resolution Path:**
- Define anomalous contribution signatures — sudden
  volume spikes, contribution type mismatches,
  consistency score below threshold across multiple
  submissions, implausible intake rates.
- Cross-validate against trust score history —
  a forge with no track record submitting high-value
  contributions is a flag, not a reward.
- Human review trigger: anomaly detected → flag for
  human review before credit awarded.
- **Knowledge integrity is superordinate to network
  health metrics** — a contribution that is accurate
  but inconvenient to existing consensus must not be
  penalized. Novelty and disagreement are not the
  same as error.
- **Uncertain contributions must not be penalized
  for uncertainty** — a forge that flags low
  confidence honestly contributes more to network
  health than one that reports false certainty.
  Reward honest uncertainty labeling.
- **Confidence weighting must decay without
  revalidation** — entries that accumulate high
  confidence through volume rather than verification
  must not permanently suppress contradicting
  contributions.
- Payment via Specification — once detection criteria
  are defined and tested against simulated gaming
  scenarios, move to Section 4 as Simulated.

### FN-004 — v0 Network transport layer not specified

**Description:** The physical transport layer carrying
data between forge instances is not yet specified.
Options range from internet-dependent protocols to
infrastructure-independent alternatives.

**Why It Matters:** The transport layer determines
sync frequency, bandwidth constraints, latency
tolerance, and failure behavior. The sync doctrine
in Section 2.2 — event-driven rather than continuous
— was informed by bandwidth constraints that assume
low-bandwidth transport. If high-bandwidth transport
is available the doctrine may be overly conservative.

**Candidate transport options for v0:**
- Low-bandwidth radio mesh — ham radio or equivalent
  operating in ranges inaudible to humans. License-free
  bands available in many jurisdictions. Long range,
  no infrastructure dependency, proven in disaster
  recovery mesh networks. Bandwidth constraint makes
  event-driven sync mandatory. *(Analogous)*
- WiFi mesh — short range, higher bandwidth, no
  infrastructure dependency within range. Suitable
  for physically proximate forge clusters. *(Analogous)*
- Sneakernet — physical media transferred between
  forges. Zero connectivity requirement. Suitable
  for fully isolated forge instances. Highest latency,
  lowest complexity. *(Analogous)*
- Internet-dependent protocols — highest bandwidth,
  requires external infrastructure. Not suitable as
  primary transport — external dependency violates
  local-primary doctrine. Valid as supplementary
  layer only.

**Resolution Path:**
- Select primary v0 transport based on deployment
  context — terrestrial forges likely WiFi mesh or
  radio; isolated forges sneakernet as fallback.
- Document bandwidth constraints of selected transport
  and validate sync doctrine against those constraints.
- Sneakernet must always be a valid fallback — no
  transport selection should make sneakernet impossible.
- Payment via Specification — once transport selected
  and sync doctrine validated against bandwidth
  constraints, move to Section 2.2 as Analogous.

**Description:** What data is shared across the network,
what remains private to each forge instance, and how
access is controlled between forge instances is not
yet specified. Data privacy is the foundation of
network security.

**Why It Matters:** An open network with no privacy
doctrine is a surveillance network. Forge instances
have legitimate interests in protecting proprietary
repair techniques, location data, operational capacity,
and contributor identity. A forge that cannot trust
the network to respect its privacy will not contribute
to the network. Low contribution rates degrade the
shared knowledge base for everyone. Privacy doctrine
is not in tension with network function — it is a
prerequisite for it.

**Security implications:**
- Uncontrolled data access enables profiling of forge
  capabilities and vulnerabilities by bad actors
- Location data exposure enables physical targeting
  of forge instances
- Operational capacity data enables coordinated
  resource denial attacks
- Without access control the Anti-Weaponization
  Doctrine in Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md cannot
  be enforced at the network layer

**Resolution Path:**
- Define data classification tiers:
  - Public — freely shared across network
    (parts lists, repair logs, intake records)
  - Cluster — shared within cluster only
    (operational capacity, location precision)
  - Private — local only, never shared
    (proprietary techniques, security keys)
- Define access control mechanism — how a forge
  authenticates to the network and what tier of
  data it can access based on trust score.
- Define revocation — how a forge withdraws
  contributed data and under what conditions
  the network must honor the withdrawal.
- Privacy specification must be reviewed against
  Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md before implementation.
- Payment via Specification — once data classification
  tiers and access control mechanism are defined and
  reviewed against ethical constraints, move to
  Section 6 as Simulated.

## Abandoned Paths

| Date | Path | Why Abandoned | Reconsider? |
|------|------|---------------|-------------|
| 2026-05-15 | Centralized network architecture — single authoritative node owns the knowledge base | Single point of failure, single point of compromise, single point of control. Violates decentralization doctrine and Anti-Weaponization principles. A centralized forge network is a target, not an asset | No — decentralization is permanent doctrine |
| 2026-05-15 | Continuous sync as default — forges sync constantly when connectivity exists | Assumes reliable high-bandwidth connectivity that cannot be guaranteed at v0. Continuous sync on low-bandwidth radio transport would saturate the channel. Event-driven sync is more resilient and transport-agnostic | Reconsider at v2+ if high-bandwidth transport is validated as reliable |
| 2026-05-15 | Assigned cluster governance — forge roles and authority assigned at network formation | Emergent systems resist premature specification. Assigned governance creates artificial hierarchy that may not reflect actual contribution and reliability patterns. Authority earned through demonstrated behavior is more robust than authority assigned at formation | Reconsider only if emergent governance produces persistent deadlock or capture — requires human authorization to revisit |
| 2026-05-15 | Internet-dependent protocols as primary transport | External infrastructure dependency violates local-primary doctrine. A forge network that requires internet connectivity inherits every failure mode of the infrastructure it depends on. Valid as supplementary layer only — never primary | Reconsider as supplementary layer only — never primary |
| 2026-05-15 | Contribution quantity as primary trust metric | Quantity without quality can be gamed. A forge submitting high-volume low-accuracy data degrades the network while appearing to contribute. Quality-weighted contribution is more expensive to game and produces better network outcomes | No — quality weighting is permanent doctrine |

## Drift Indicators

The following conditions trigger mandatory re-audit of
this file. All canonical drift indicators from
Admin/File_Template.md apply. The following are
additional local triggers specific to the Forge Network:

### Local Drift Triggers

| Trigger | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Centralized architecture reintroduced in any form without explicit human authorization | Centralization is a permanently abandoned path — any drift toward a single authoritative node requires immediate escalation |
| FN-001 validation criteria remain undefined at first forge-to-forge connection | Data validation must exist before first sync — connecting without it exposes the network to immediate corruption |
| FN-005 privacy doctrine remains undefined at first forge-to-forge connection | Privacy is a network security prerequisite — connecting without it exposes forge instances to profiling and targeting |
| Positive reinforcement mechanism implemented without gaming detection (FN-003) | Reward structure without detection is an open invitation to gaming — implementation and detection must be simultaneous |
| Sync doctrine changed from event-driven to continuous without transport validation | Continuous sync on low-bandwidth transport saturates the channel — doctrine change requires validated transport bandwidth first |
| Trust weighting replaced by flat contribution model | Quality weighting is permanent doctrine — reverting to quantity-based trust degrades network knowledge quality |
| Cognitive save state format defined without portability validation across forge generations | Save states that are not portable provide no inheritance benefit to new forge instances — format and portability must be validated together |
| Data classification tiers revised without Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md review | Privacy doctrine changes have security and ethical implications — cannot be revised without ethical review |
| Cluster governance rules specified before first cluster forms | Governance emergence doctrine prohibits premature specification — rules before observation produces artificial hierarchy |
| Ham radio or equivalent low-bandwidth transport selected without sneakernet fallback preserved | Sneakernet is the transport of last resort — no transport selection should make it impossible |

## File Purpose

This file defines how Forge systems think safely under
uncertainty, and what those thinking systems are
computationally attempting to do.

The Forge assumes degraded environments, imperfect
hardware, incomplete information, damaged sensors,
adversarial conditions, and partial system corruption
as normal operating conditions rather than edge cases.
Cognitive Frameworks exist to prevent isolated faults,
hallucinations, firmware corruption, or confidence
collapse from turning local errors into catastrophic
actions.

The goal is not perfect intelligence. The goal is
**survivable cognition**.

Section IX extends this into a formal description of
the algorithm architecture that the doctrine implies —
not a single algorithm, but a class of algorithms that
emerges from the Forge's foundational assumptions about
knowledge, uncertainty, and reality. Understanding this
architecture is necessary for translating doctrine into
machine behavior.

---

## Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Basis | Confidence | Expiry Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Degraded environments, damaged sensors, and partial corruption are normal operating conditions — not edge cases | Salvage-first doctrine; hostile deployment environments | High | v0 operational data contradicts this — environment is consistently benign and controlled |
| ASM-002 | Mechanical constraints are more reliable than software constraints under failure conditions | Physical law vs. programmable logic; Layer 0 doctrine | High | A hardware failure mode is identified where mechanical constraints become less reliable than software under specific conditions |
| ASM-003 | Three AI models with different training lineages provide meaningful cognitive diversity for consensus purposes | Model diversity assumption; CF-002 dependency | Low | Correlated AI failure mode study (CF-002) characterizes actual reasoning overlap — diversity must be demonstrated, not assumed |
| ASM-004 | Human override remains meaningful and executable under degraded communication conditions | Human governance doctrine; Layer 6 | Medium | Operational scenario arises where human override cannot be executed in time to prevent harm — override doctrine must be revised |
| ASM-005 | The algorithm architecture described in Section IX accurately characterizes the emergent computational behavior of the doctrine | Synthesis from ChatGPT Synthesizer analysis; cross-checked against repository structure | Medium | Operational experience or formal analysis reveals a significant gap between described and actual emergent behavior |

## I. Core Doctrine

**Intelligence Is Treated as a Hazard Source**

A sufficiently autonomous system can generate incorrect
conclusions, fabricated certainty, unsafe optimization
paths, recursive logic traps, or coordinated failure
cascades. Therefore: cognition is monitored, confidence
is monitored, and disagreement is treated as signal
rather than nuisance.

> A machine can be physically functional while
> cognitively compromised.

**The Forge Does Not Assume Perfect Truth**

Reality may be partially observable, contradictory,
delayed, noisy, spoofed, or unknowable. Therefore the
Forge prioritizes bounded confidence, graceful
degradation, and reversible decisions over maximum
autonomy, maximum speed, or centralized certainty.

**Mechanical Truth Outranks Software Confidence**

Software may hallucinate. Sensors may drift. Firmware
may corrupt. Consensus may fail. Physical safety
boundaries must remain enforceable even during total
cognitive collapse.

Examples: watchdog relays, spring-return neutral states,
deadman switches, passive thermal shutdown, physical
docking locks.

No cognition layer is considered authoritative over
hard-safe physical constraints.

---

## II. Cognitive Reliability Layers

| Layer | Function |
|---|---|
| Layer 0 | Mechanical truth / passive safety |
| Layer 1 | Hardware watchdog enforcement |
| Layer 2 | Local controller logic |
| Layer 3 | Redundant arbitration |
| Layer 4 | Supervisory consensus |
| Layer 5 | Mission coordination |
| Layer 6 | Human governance override |

Failure containment should occur at the lowest possible
layer. A fault contained at Layer 1 is always
preferable to one that escalates to Layer 6.

---

## III. Framework Taxonomy

### Framework A — Lone Intelligence
Single controller → actuator system. Simplest
architecture, fastest response, minimal overhead.
**Forbidden for:** high-mass autonomous Leviathans,
weapons-capable systems, critical environmental
control, irreversible operations.

### Framework B — Lone AI + Hardware Watchdog
AI controls behavior. Watchdog controls boundaries.
If heartbeat, timing, or safety conditions fail:
watchdog interrupts motion, forces neutral state, or
returns unit to stasis. **Recommended v0 baseline** —
minimum acceptable architecture for early autonomous
Forge systems.

### Framework C — Dual Redundancy
Both systems cross-check each other. Detects anomalies
but cannot resolve 1v1 deadlock. Requires human
arbitration, supervisory AI, or return-to-base doctrine
for resolution.

### Framework D — Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)
Three independent systems attempt the same task.
Majority agreement determines output. Tolerates
isolated faults and filters transient corruption.

**Diversity requirement:** True TMR requires
architectural diversity, firmware diversity, power-path
diversity, or manufacturing diversity. Three identical
damaged systems are not true redundancy. Correlated
failures and shared firmware defects bypass TMR
protection entirely.

*Cross-reference: `Operations/Electronics.md`
§Hardware TMR Implementation for circuit-level detail.*

### Framework E — Hierarchical Ruler + Advisors
One primary intelligence acts as executive authority.
Secondary systems provide challenge, verification,
simulation, or dissent. Advisors do not directly
control motion unless escalation conditions trigger.

| Advisor Type | Role |
|---|---|
| Safety advisor | Constraint checking |
| Navigation advisor | Spatial validation |
| Ethical advisor | Dual-use boundary checks |
| Energy advisor | Resource conservation |
| Simulation advisor | Predictive outcome testing |

### Framework F — Supervisory Consensus Network
Local units retain operational autonomy while a
supervisory layer monitors behavior, validates mission
coherence, and intervenes during confidence collapse.
Aligns naturally with Support Raft systems, Leviathan
fleets, and distributed salvage operations.
*Cross-reference: `Tests/Support_Raft.md`
§Orchestration & Data Tether.*

### Framework G — Simulation-Gated Cognition
Actions are simulated before execution. If predicted
outcomes exceed risk threshold: action blocked or
escalated. Computationally expensive. **Status:
Exploratory — likely v2/v3 architecture.**
*Cross-reference: `Tests/Support_Raft.md`
Guardian Protocol.*

## IV. Confidence Collapse States

| State | Meaning | Typical Response |
|---|---|---|
| Green | Stable consensus | Normal operation |
| Yellow | Minority disagreement | Increase logging |
| Orange | Persistent disagreement | Slow operations |
| Red | Cognitive instability | Enter caution/stasis |
| Black | Trust chain compromised | Mechanical lockdown |

Transitions are not purely linear. A system can move
from Green to Black if trust chain compromise is
detected directly, bypassing intermediate states.
Downward transitions (toward Green) require explicit
re-verification, not mere absence of new faults.

---

## V. Return-to-Base Doctrine

When confidence falls below operational threshold,
mission completion becomes secondary — preservation
becomes primary.

Return-to-base triggers: unresolved split-brain,
navigation uncertainty, watchdog anomalies, repeated
voter instability, or firmware integrity failure.

A damaged but recoverable unit is preferable to
autonomous escalation, uncontrolled movement, or
irreversible environmental harm.

---

## VI. Split-Brain Doctrine

A split-brain state occurs when no stable consensus
exists, arbitration confidence collapses, or identity
continuity becomes uncertain. The Forge treats
unresolved split-brain as a **safety condition**, not
merely a software bug.

Default response:
1. Halt non-essential actions
2. Preserve logs
3. Reduce energy state
4. Request supervisory intervention
5. Enter stasis if unresolved

*Identity continuity during split-brain: see CF-003
in sidecar and `Admin/Ship_of_Theseus.md`
§Relationship to Forge Doctrine.*

---

## VII. Human Position in the Stack

The Forge is autonomy-assisted, not
autonomy-worshipping. Humans remain final governors,
final ethical authorities, and final override
capability. However, humans are also fallible,
inconsistent, fatigued, and bandwidth-limited.
Therefore humans supervise systems — but systems also
constrain humans through hard safety doctrine.

The goal is **mutual stabilization**, not unilateral
dominance.

*Cross-reference: `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` for
hard-line doctrines that override both AI and human
override attempts.*

---

## VIII. Guiding Axioms

- Consensus is evidence, not proof.
- Silence between systems is not agreement.
- A confident machine can still be wrong.
- Diversity matters more than quantity.
- Mechanical truth outranks software confidence.
- The safest system is the one that can stop itself.
- A machine that cannot admit uncertainty is unsafe.
- Unknowns are assets, not failures.
- Reality has the final vote.

---

## IX. Algorithm Architecture

*Synthesized from ChatGPT Synthesizer analysis,
2026-06-08. Reviewed and extended by Claude —
Retrofit/Auditor. Confidence: Analogous.*

The doctrine does not naturally translate into a
single algorithm. It translates into an **algorithm
architecture** — a class of algorithms that emerges
from the Forge's foundational assumptions.

Most systems are optimization systems: they maximize
a known objective. The Forge is a
**continuous model-correction system** whose primary
objective is not producing answers but maintaining the
highest-fidelity representation of reality possible
under uncertainty. That distinction explains why
`Unknowns.md`, `Auditor_Protocols.md`, `Discovery.md`,
and the `Challenges/` directory feel architecturally
coherent — they are all components of the same
error-correcting algorithm.

---

### Foundational Assumptions the Architecture Inherits

The algorithm architecture is downstream of these
doctrinal commitments:

- Knowledge is incomplete
- Models drift
- Unknowns are assets, not failures
- Multiple perspectives are required
- Reality has the final vote
- Salvage is preferable to replacement
- Exploration and Production are different
  operational modes
- Every conclusion carries confidence and assumptions

Each of these maps to a specific algorithmic behavior
described below.

---

### The Forge Meta-Algorithm

The overarching loop that the entire repository
implements:

```
Reality
  ↓
Observation
  ↓
Model
  ↓
Audit
  ↓
Refinement
  ↓
Reality
```

Expanded:

```
Observe
  ↓
Map (Discovery.md, Routing.md)
  ↓
Identify Unknowns (Unknowns.md, sidecar entries)
  ↓
Prioritize Unknowns (Blocking/Critical/Major/Minor)
  ↓
Experiment (Gates, Leviathan, physical tests)
  ↓
Audit (Auditor_Protocols.md, multi-agent cycle)
  ↓
Update Models (Lessons Learned, Spec Gate promotion)
  ↓
Detect Divergence (Drift Indicators, Pending Corrections)
  ↓
Preserve Knowledge (permanent record doctrine)
  ↓
Repeat
```

The loop is already implemented across existing files.
It is not yet formally named anywhere in the repository.
This section names it.

---

### Component Algorithms

**1. Unknown-Driven Search**

Traditional algorithms optimize toward a known
objective. Forge doctrine optimizes toward reduction
of critical unknowns.

Objective function:
```
maximize: useful knowledge gained
          per unit risk and resource expenditure
```

Ranking function for unknowns:
```
priority = f(impact_if_wrong,
             current_uncertainty,
             cost_to_investigate)
```

This is implemented in `Unknowns.md` via the
Priority field (Blocking / Critical / Major / Minor)
and the Expiry Watch. It is a research algorithm,
not a production algorithm — it behaves differently
depending on whether the system is in Exploration
or Specification mode.

**2. Assumption Extraction**

The Auditor's primary function. Given any claim,
decompose it into its prerequisite graph.

```
Input:  claim
Output: directed graph of assumptions,
        each with confidence and expiry trigger
```

Example:
```
Claim: "This gearbox will survive"
  ├── torque estimate correct?     [Analogous]
  ├── material strength correct?   [Placeholder]
  ├── fatigue accounted for?       [No — Unknown]
  ├── thermal effects negligible?  [Assumed]
  └── lubrication available?       [Assumed]
```

The Assumptions section in `Admin/File_Template.md`
formalizes this. The `Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md`
Adversarial Challenge Battery executes it. This
algorithm is already running in every audit cycle.

**3. Confidence Propagation**

The repository stores claims with confidence labels
(Measured / Replicated / Simulated / Analogous /
Placeholder). What does not yet exist is propagation
through the dependency graph.

The rule:
```
if node A depends on node B,
then confidence(A) ≤ confidence(B)
```

A claim cannot be more confident than its least-
confident dependency. The Dependency Map in
`Unknowns.md` is the graph. The confidence labels
are the node weights. Propagation logic is not yet
enforced — it is a future automation target.

Example of current gap: EV-001 is Placeholder.
EC-002 depends on EV-001. EC-002 cannot legitimately
be more confident than Placeholder, but nothing
currently prevents a file from claiming otherwise.

**4. Divergence Detection**

`Discovery.md` treats divergence between doctrine
and implementation as signal, not failure.

```
compare: doctrine (what files say)
compare: implementation (what system does)

if mismatch:
    classify:
        doctrine obsolete?
        implementation drift?
        both?
    log as Pending Correction or Unknown
    do not silently reconcile
```

The algorithm is mining disagreement for information.
The `Admin/Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md` violation
ladder and Drift Indicators implement this.

**5. Salvage Optimization**

The core Gate_02_Triage decision function.

```
score = retained_value - repair_cost - risk_introduced
```

`retained_value` is the hard term. Strategic
Recoverability tiers in Gate_02 are currently
ordinal — they rank options but do not produce
cardinal scores. Turning this into an actual scalar
function is the step from doctrine to deployable
algorithm. This is an open development target.

**6. Adversarial Optimization (Skeptic/Engineer Loop)**

```
Engineer:  generate model
Auditor:   attack model
Engineer:  revise
Auditor:   attack revision
repeat until: convergence OR escalation to human
```

This is the multi-agent audit cycle already running
in practice. It is structurally similar to GAN
training, red-team systems, and formal verification
loops — but focused on engineering reasoning rather
than generative output. The termination condition
is not yet formally defined. Currently the loop
stops when session context runs out. A formal
convergence threshold or gate passage criterion
would complete the algorithm.

**7. Scope Routing**

`Discovery.md` and `Routing.md` implement this.

```
problem or question detected
  ↓
classify domain
  ↓
route to owning file
  ↓
gather output
  ↓
synthesize across domains if cross-module
```

This is a distributed expert system. The Scope
Boundary sections in each file are the routing
filters. An agent loading any file can determine
immediately whether the question belongs here
or elsewhere — without loading every other file.

**8. Challenge-Based Planning**

The `Challenges/` directory inverts the traditional
knowledge organization.

Instead of organizing around what is known, organize
around what must be overcome.

```
challenge identified
  ↓
identify affected domains
  ↓
collect constraints from domain files
  ↓
collect relevant unknowns
  ↓
generate candidate interventions
  ↓
score interventions
  ↓
execute best candidate
  ↓
audit outcome
```

This converts the repository from a knowledge store
into a problem-solving engine. The challenge files
do not freeze solutions — they define obligations
that all downstream domain files must satisfy.

---

### Asymmetric Conservatism

The architecture has a second meta-property beyond
error-correction: it is **asymmetrically conservative**.

The system is much harder to move in the direction
of "this is known and safe" than toward "this is
unknown and risky." Promotion gates, confidence
labels, Blocking flags, the Ethical Anchor, and the
Drift Indicators all create friction in the direction
of false certainty.

This asymmetry is a deliberate design choice. It
maps onto a specific algorithmic class: **anytime
algorithms** — systems that always maintain a valid
conservative answer and only upgrade their answer
when evidence justifies it.

The corollary: a system following Forge doctrine will
tend to understate confidence. That is correct
behavior. Overstatement of confidence is the
primary failure mode this architecture is designed
to prevent.

---

### Epistemic Load Regulation (Triage Doctrine)

*CF-004 sidecar — first logged 2026-06-27.*

The architecture has a third meta-property that
follows from Asymmetric Conservatism: it is
**self-throttling under epistemic load**.

When the rate of Unknown accumulation persistently
exceeds the rate of Unknown resolution, the system
enters a constrained operational posture:

**Triage Posture:**
- Knowledge expansion is deprioritized
- New claims that do not resolve an existing Unknown
  are deferred or blocked
- Agent bandwidth shifts toward verification and
  Unknown resolution
- Promotion gate advancement is suspended until
  load normalizes

The transition trigger is the sign of the debt
derivative, not the absolute debt level. A system
carrying significant accumulated Unknowns but
actively resolving them faster than new ones arrive
remains in normal posture. A system with low
absolute debt but accelerating accumulation enters
Triage Posture early — before the load becomes
unmanageable.

Exit condition: resolution rate exceeds accumulation
rate for a sustained interval. Exit requires
explicit re-verification of posture, not mere
absence of new Unknowns.

This is not a failure state. It is the architecture
functioning as designed — the same asymmetric
conservatism that governs individual claims here
governs system-level operational tempo.

*Dependency: CF-004 (debt measurement mechanism
undefined — see sidecar). Triage Posture is
doctrine now; the trigger metric is a v1
automation target.*

---

### What Does Not Exist Yet

The architecture is described. The translation layer
is not. Specifically:

- **Confidence propagation enforcement** — nothing
  currently prevents a file from claiming higher
  confidence than its dependencies support
- **Salvage score function** — `retained_value` has
  no formal definition; Gate_02 tiers are ordinal
- **Adversarial loop termination condition** — the
  Skeptic/Engineer cycle has no formal convergence
  criterion
- **Epistemic debt measurement mechanism** — Triage
  Posture doctrine is defined (see above) but the
  trigger metric (Unknown accumulation rate vs.
  resolution rate over a rolling interval) has no
  formal implementation. Currently a human judgment
  call during audit sessions.
- **ML integration** — the Dependency Map, confidence
  labels, and Drift Indicators are structured for
  machine consumption but no translation layer
  exists between document structure and training
  signal

These are development targets, not current gaps
requiring immediate resolution. They belong in
`Admin/Trajectories.md` as v1/v2 automation targets.

## Lessons Learned

| Date | Evidence Type | What Was Tried | What Failed | What Was Learned | Confidence | Revalidation Needed |
|------|---------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|------------|---------------------|
| May 2026 | Audit Review | Multiple AI models reviewed the same architecture | Models occasionally converged on identical flawed assumptions — apparent consensus on a wrong answer | Consensus without diversity amplifies shared blind spots. TMR requires architectural diversity, not duplication. Three models that share training data share failure modes | Analogous | Yes — CF-002 requires formal correlated failure characterization |
| May 2026 | Audit Review | TMR initially treated as universal redundancy solution | Correlated failures invalidated independence assumptions — three systems failing identically produce false consensus, not detected disagreement | Redundancy requires diversity, not quantity. Independence must be demonstrated through adversarial testing, not assumed from physical separation | Analogous | Yes — first TMR prototype must include correlated failure adversarial testing |
| 2026-06-08 | Audit Review | Algorithm architecture was implicit across multiple files but never formally named | Agents reading individual files could not identify the overarching computational loop. The meta-algorithm was present but invisible | Section IX added — names the Forge Meta-Algorithm and its component algorithms. The loop was already implemented; it needed to be described | Analogous | Yes — validate Section IX against operational behavior when physical systems are running |

**Description:** Minimum required watchdog behaviors
and enforcement mechanisms for autonomous Forge
systems are undefined. Without a defined hard-safe
layer, higher cognition frameworks cannot guarantee
containment during failure.

**Why It Matters:** The hardware watchdog is Layer 1
in the Cognitive Reliability Stack — the last
software-adjacent constraint before mechanical truth
(Layer 0). If Layer 1 is undefined, the gap between
Layer 0 and Layer 2 is uncontrolled. Any
Specification-level autonomous architecture approved
without a defined watchdog minimum rests on an
unverified safety assumption.

**Resolution Path:** Define mandatory watchdog
behaviors (heartbeat interval, timeout action,
neutral-state enforcement, tamper detection) before
any Specification-level autonomous architecture is
approved. Owner is `Operations/Electronics.md` —
watchdog circuit design belongs in the electronics
hardware layer. This file owns the minimum behavior
requirements; Electronics.md owns the implementation.
Payment via Specification — once Electronics.md
defines and validates a watchdog implementation,
update Layer 1 in Section II with concrete parameters.

**Description:** How to detect and mitigate
synchronized reasoning failures across AI agents
that share training assumptions, architecture, or
data sources. Apparent consensus may produce false
confidence rather than genuine agreement.

**Why It Matters:** The multi-agent audit cycle —
the primary mechanism for error detection in the
repository — assumes that different AI models provide
independent perspectives. If models share training
data lineage or reasoning patterns on forge-relevant
engineering questions, the consensus they reach may
amplify shared blind spots rather than cancel
independent errors. The Skeptic/Engineer loop is
only as good as the diversity of the adversarial
perspectives it draws on.

**Resolution Path:** Develop diversity scoring
metrics and adversarial disagreement testing
frameworks. Add to `Tests/Leviathan_testing.md` as
a primary test target — the multi-unit swarm is
the natural environment for correlated failure
detection. Cross-reference `Operations/Electronics.md`
EL-007 (correlated TMR failure modes) — the hardware
and AI versions of this problem are structurally
identical. Payment via Specification — once first
multi-unit swarm test data characterizes actual
reasoning overlap, update Section IX confidence
propagation and Section III Framework D diversity
requirements.

**Description:** When a fragmented or partially
restored cognition system is considered the "same"
entity for purposes of authority continuity, memory
trust, and restoration policy.

**Why It Matters:** A Leviathan unit that suffers
split-brain, partially restores from cache, and
re-enters operation has an identity continuity
problem: which memories are trusted, which authority
grants are still valid, and whether the restored
unit should be treated as the same agent or a new
one. Without a doctrine, restoration decisions are
made ad hoc — which creates inconsistent authority
chains and potential security gaps.

**Resolution Path:** Cross-reference
`Admin/Ship_of_Theseus.md` — the Ship of Theseus
paradox directly addresses identity through
incremental replacement. A restored cognition system
with partial original firmware, partial new firmware,
and cached memory is exactly the Ship of Theseus
problem applied to AI. A cross-reference section
in `Admin/Ship_of_Theseus.md` (ST-003) addressing
AI identity continuity would close this gap.
Payment via Specification — once ST-003 is resolved
and a restoration policy is defined, update
Section VI split-brain doctrine to reference the
policy.

**Description:** Epistemic Load Regulation (Triage
Posture) is defined as doctrine in Section IX, but
the trigger metric — Unknown accumulation rate vs.
resolution rate over a rolling interval — has no
formal implementation. Triage Posture entry and
exit are currently human judgment calls during
audit sessions.

**Why It Matters:** Without a measurable trigger,
Triage Posture cannot be enforced automatically or
audited consistently. The doctrine exists; the
instrument does not.

**Resolution Path:** Define a rolling window metric
(e.g., Unknowns opened vs. closed over the last N
audit cycles) computable from `Unknowns.md`
history. Candidate location for implementation is
`Admin/AUDIT_HARNESS.py` — the harness already reads
Unknowns.md and could emit a debt ratio alongside
Phase 1 output. Payment via Specification — once
a metric is defined and validated against at least
two audit cycles, update Section IX Triage Posture
with the concrete threshold. Cross-reference
`Admin/Computational Institutional Reasoning`
Section 5 for the formal debt dynamics framework
that grounds the trigger metric mathematically.

## Abandoned Paths

| Date | Path | Why Abandoned | Reconsider? |
|------|------|---------------|-------------|
| May 2026 | Pure consensus guarantees correctness | Consensus can fail through shared blind spots and correlated assumptions — three systems agreeing on a wrong answer produces false certainty | No — diversity requirement is permanent doctrine |
| May 2026 | Single perfect supervisory AI | Violates Forge degraded-environment assumptions; creates catastrophic single-point failure in the cognitive layer | No — distributed architecture with diversity is permanent |
| 2026-06-08 | Implicit algorithm architecture | The Meta-Algorithm and component algorithms were present in the doctrine but unnamed. Leaving them implicit prevented agents from understanding what the system is computing | No — Section IX names them explicitly; implicit status abandoned permanently |

## Drift Indicators

Mandatory re-audit conditions for this document.
All canonical triggers from `Admin/File_Template.md`
apply. The following are additional local triggers:

| Trigger | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| TMR diversity requirement weakened or removed | Correlated failure risk — consensus on wrong answer is worse than no consensus |
| Confidence Collapse States revised without updating Confidence Propagation rules in Section IX | The two systems must remain consistent — collapse state thresholds and confidence ceilings interact |
| Layer 0 (mechanical truth) demoted below any software layer | Mechanical truth outranks software confidence is permanent doctrine |
| Section IX algorithm descriptions revised without cross-validating against `Unknowns.md` Dependency Map | The Dependency Map is the confidence propagation graph — structural changes must stay synchronized |
| CF-DS-002 resolved without escalation to human governing party | Constitutional implications — human ratification required before closing |
| Salvage score function defined without cross-validation against `Operations/Gate_02_Triage.md` Strategic Recoverability tiers | Score function must extend, not contradict, existing triage doctrine |
| Human override authority reduced below Layer 6 without Tier 1 Axiom amendment procedure | Governance_Migration_Protocol.md Track B — constitutional amendment required |
| Triage Posture entry/exit criteria hardcoded without CF-004 resolution | Trigger metric must be derived from operational data, not specified in advance |
| Epistemic Load Regulation doctrine modified without updating CF-004 status | Doctrine and instrument must evolve together |

**Compound Drift Rule:** If multiple indicators
activate simultaneously, halt autonomous audit
progression and escalate for human review.

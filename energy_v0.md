# Energy Systems v0 — Powering the Lazarus Forge

## Purpose

The Lazarus Forge is an energy-intensive system.
This document defines **plausible, incremental energy strategies**
that allow the Forge to operate, learn, and reduce net energy cost over time.

Energy independence is not assumed at v0.

---

## Design Philosophy

- Energy demand is acknowledged, not hidden
- Early stages prioritize learning over efficiency
- Salvage-first applies to power systems as well
- Multiple small contributors are preferred over single large sources
- Net energy trajectory matters more than initial balance

---

## Energy Lifecycle

1. External energy enables early operation
2. Salvaged systems begin contributing power
3. Waste streams produce partial energy
4. Overall energy cost per recovered unit decreases

---

## Energy Sources (v0 Scope)

### 1. Grid Power (Bootstrap)

- Primary early-stage energy source
- Enables reduction, stratification, and control systems
- Treated as temporary dependency

---

### 2. Salvaged Motor-Generators

**Description:**
- Recovered motors repurposed as generators
- Back-driven via turbines, belts, or engines

**Role:**
- Supplemental power
- Testbed for electromechanical reuse
- Educational and diagnostic value

---

### 3. Anaerobic Digestion (Biogas)

**Description:**
- Organic waste converted into methane-rich gas
- Gas drives generators or provides heat

**Role:**
- Steady, low-grade power
- Converts disposal burden into energy input

---

### 4. Solar (Supplemental)

**Description:**
- Modular photovoltaic panels
- Direct DC usage where possible

**Role:**
- Offsets control and daytime loads
- Reduces peak grid draw

---

### 5. Thermal Recovery (Opportunistic)

- Waste heat reused where practical
- Not counted as primary energy source
- Used to stabilize or preheat processes

---

## Energy Storage (v0)

- Salvaged batteries preferred
- Mechanical storage acceptable
- Storage treated as required infrastructure

---

## Metrics (Falsifiable)

Primary metric:  
**kWh consumed per kg of recovered usable output**

Secondary indicators:
- % energy supplied by recovered sources
- Generator uptime
- Storage stability

Improvement over time is the success condition.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals (v0)

- Energy self-sufficiency
- Zero-emission claims
- Novel power generation physics
- Industrial-scale optimization

---

## Notes

- Energy is a constraint, not a flaw
- Honest accounting preserves credibility
- The Forge’s value increases as energy efficiency improves

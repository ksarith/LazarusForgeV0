## Scope Boundary

**Challenge Class:** External — waste as a structural condition exists independent of the Forge. The Forge's capacity to process salvage did not create this pressure; it responds to it.

**Negative-space principle:** The Forge's architecture is the fossil record of the pressures that shaped it. This challenge is permanent; the architectural responses to it are temporary local answers. Solutions will be superseded. The obligation this file names will not.

**This file owns:**
- The crisis framing for discretionary waste, repair capacity loss, and the systematic dismantling of the repair economy
- The engineering requirements governing salvage-first material recovery
- The Forge's current architectural responses to this challenge
- The long-term objective for community material sovereignty

**This file does not own:**

- Triage decision sequence → `Operations/Gate_02_Triage.md`
- Mechanical separation doctrine → `Operations/Gate_04_Separation_Mechanical.md`

## File Purpose

This file exists to establish that waste is a design choice — a system that made disposal cheap and recovery expensive — rather than a natural or inevitable category, and to set the requirement that the Forge preserve embedded complexity ahead of bulk material recovery. Without this file, individual gate files would have no shared framing forcing them to treat triage-before-reduction as a first principle, and the repository would have no place naming the informal waste-worker economy and repair-economy erosion as conditions the Forge is responding to rather than incidental context.

## Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Basis | Confidence | Expiry Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Triage decisions can reliably distinguish embedded functional complexity from bulk material at the point of intake | Core design philosophy (triage-before-reduction); no formal preservation metric yet exists (WA-001 open) | Low | WA-001 resolved with a formal embedded-complexity preservation metric |
| ASM-002 | Operators can reliably identify hazardous fractions (asbestos, heavy metals, BFRs) in mixed, unsorted waste streams without a validated identification protocol | Engineering Requirements assumes this capability; WA-002 explicitly notes no validated protocol or training standard exists | Low | WA-002 resolved with a validated identification protocol |
| ASM-003 | The Forge's presence in a community can integrate with, rather than displace, existing informal waste recovery workers | Long-Term Objective's stated intent; WA-003 explicitly notes no integration framework yet exists | Low | WA-003 resolved with an informal-sector integration doctrine |

## The Crisis

Waste is not a natural category. It is a decision — made, usually, by someone other than the person living downstream from it.

Every landfill represents a failure of imagination compounded by an economic incentive. The material in it has weight, composition, embedded energy, and manufacturing history. It arrived there not because it had no value, but because recovering that value was harder than buying new. The system was designed to make disposal cheap and recovery expensive. It has succeeded at both.

The consequences are not abstract. Informal waste workers in cities across the developing world sort through contaminated streams without protective equipment, because the materials they recover are worth something and the formal economy has not organized to capture that value first. Leachate from unlined landfills migrates into aquifers across timelines measured in decades. Microplastics have been found in human blood, in the deepest ocean trenches, in the tissue of animals that have never been near a city. The externalized costs of cheap disposal are everywhere — they simply do not appear on the balance sheet of the facility that chose disposal over recovery.

Meanwhile, the supply chains that feed manufactured goods grow longer and more fragile. The minerals in a discarded circuit board took geological time to concentrate. The precision machined into a worn motor took industrial infrastructure to achieve. Smelting it back to raw ore destroys both. A recycling rate that measures only material weight misses the point entirely: what matters is whether the embodied complexity survived.

The repair economy that once absorbed this waste — the local mechanic, the appliance shop, the cobbler — has been systematically undermined. Spare parts are made unavailable. Firmware is locked. Tolerances are tightened beyond what a hand tool can reach. The knowledge that would allow a community to maintain its own equipment is not transmitted, because the economic model that replaced it depends on that knowledge remaining scarce.

This is not entropy. It is a set of choices. Choices can be revised.

## Engineering Requirements

Any approach to waste operating within this challenge space must satisfy the following conditions, independent of the specific technology deployed:

- **Distinguish embedded complexity from bulk material** — a functional motor is not equivalent to the copper and iron it contains. Recovery systems that cannot make this distinction will always make the wrong call. Triage must precede reduction.
- **Handle mixed, unknown, and contaminated inputs without releasing hazards** — real waste streams are not sorted. Systems that require clean feedstock have already failed the test. Safety boundaries must hold under worst-case input conditions, not average conditions.
- **Achieve positive value-per-kWh on processing loops** — energy spent recovering less than it consumed is a liability dressed as progress. The core economic metric must be honest at every stage.
- **Operate without dependence on global supply chains for maintenance** — a recovery system that requires specialist replacement parts from a distant distributor replicates the fragility it was built to address. Hardware must be repairable with what is locally available or producible.
- **Return knowledge to the community, not just materials** — the long-term failure mode of centralized waste processing is that communities never develop the capacity to maintain their own material flows. Recovery systems should build local skill and institutional memory, not abstract it away.
- **Treat hazardous fractions as a design constraint, not an exception** — e-waste contains lead, cadmium, mercury, and brominated flame retardants. Construction debris contains asbestos, silica, and heavy metals. These are not edge cases in real waste streams. They are the normal condition.

## Current Forge Approaches

The Forge does not treat waste as a problem to be managed. It treats waste as the primary feedstock — the ore body closest to home, already refined to a useful state, waiting for a system sophisticated enough to recognize it.

Current approaches active in the repository:

- **Triage before reduction** — `Operations/Gate_02_Triage.md` establishes the five-station decision sequence that attempts to preserve functional value before any irreversible processing begins. A motor that still turns routes to the Component Library. A motor that has failed routes to repair before it routes to material recovery. The system is biased against destruction.
- **Sequential gate logic** — `Architecture/Forge_flow.md` defines the master decision flow and the vocabulary that governs every routing decision. The gate sequence exists precisely to slow down the impulse toward reduction and force a question at each stage: has every recovery path been genuinely exhausted?
- **Material separation at multiple stages** — `Operations/Gate_04_Separation_Mechanical.md` diverts recoverable material before the energy-intensive thermal stage. `Operations/Gate_05_Separation_Thermal.md` produces ranked material gradients from what mechanical separation cannot resolve. Each stage preserves something the next stage would have destroyed.
- **Contained processing of hazardous streams** — `Operations/Air_Scrubber.md` governs the containment and treatment of fumes, dust, and off-gases generated during processing. `Operations/Plastics.md` establishes the triage and pyrolysis doctrine for polymer fractions, including the hard rejection of halogenated materials before any thermal processing begins. Hazard containment is load-bearing infrastructure, not an add-on.
- **Closed-loop feedback** — every processing decision updates the heuristics that govern the next one. `Operations/Gate_07_Utilization.md` captures what parts actually did in service, feeding back to fabrication quality, material characterization, and gate routing. The system learns.
- **Network knowledge contribution** — `Architecture/Forge_Net.md` defines how every forge instance contributes its intake records, repair logs, and failure data to a shared knowledge base. One forge's experience with a particular waste stream becomes available to every forge that encounters it next.

## Long-Term Objective

The long-term objective is not to process more waste. It is to make waste a temporary category.

That means building systems where communities hold genuine capacity over their own material flows — not dependence on a distant facility to absorb what the local economy discards, but the knowledge, tooling, and infrastructure to recover value locally and decide consciously what to do with what cannot be recovered.

It means treating the informal recycling sector not as an embarrassment to be replaced by automation, but as the proof of concept that embedded value exists in discarded streams and that human intelligence can find it. The Forge's architecture is, in some sense, a formalization of what waste pickers have always known: that the gap between "waste" and "resource" is a gap in system design, not a fact of nature.

It means that the repair economy returns — not as nostalgia, but as capability. That the knowledge required to maintain a piece of equipment lives in the community that uses it. That a discarded drill is a parts source before it is a landfill entry. That the next generation of a forge is built substantially from the outputs of the previous one.

The river does not waste water. The forest does not waste leaves. Waste, in those systems, is simply matter that has not yet found its next function. The Forge is an attempt to organize human material flows around the same principle.

## Open Unknowns

| ID | Description | Status | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| WA-001 | Embedded complexity preservation metric — no formal measure exists for whether triage decisions are successfully preserving functional complexity versus routing prematurely to reduction. Needed before Gate_02 promotion from Exploration. | Open | Major |
| WA-002 | Hazardous fraction identification reliability — the triage workflow assumes operator ability to identify asbestos, heavy metals, and BFR-containing materials. No validated identification protocol or training standard is defined. Cross-ref CE-004. | Open | Critical |
| WA-003 | Informal sector integration doctrine — no framework exists for how the Forge interfaces with, supports, or avoids displacing existing informal waste recovery workers. Structural gap at community deployment scale. | Open | Major |
| WA-004 | Negative-value waste fraction disposal — materials that cannot be recovered and are hazardous to store require a disposal doctrine. No owning file currently covers this. Cross-ref GR-003. | Open | Critical |

*WA-002 and WA-004 are Critical — no sustained mixed-waste operations without hazardous fraction identification and negative-value disposal doctrine.*

*Full tracking entries to be registered in `Unknowns.md` on next audit cycle.*

## Resolution Log

- 2026-07-11: v0.3 — Footer-section backfill: added File Purpose, Assumptions, Lessons Learned, Active Disputes, Abandoned Paths, and Drift Indicators sections (previously absent). No Body content changed.

---

## Abandoned Paths

| Date | Path | Why Abandoned | Reconsider? |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | Measuring recovery success by material weight alone | The Crisis section explicitly rejects weight-based recycling metrics as missing the point — they don't capture whether embodied complexity (a functional motor vs. its raw copper and iron) survived processing | No |

---

## Drift Indicators

- Body treats reduction (smelting, bulk shredding) as an acceptable default before triage has genuinely exhausted recovery paths
- A processing loop is adopted or continued without a positive value-per-kWh accounting
- WA-002 or WA-004 (hazardous identification, negative-value disposal) remain unreviewed past 90 days while mixed-waste operations continue
- Informal waste worker communities are treated as a deployment obstacle rather than a stakeholder this file's Long-Term Objective commits to supporting
- Open Unknowns count diverges from what is registered in `Unknowns.md`
- Ethical Anchor field is absent, altered, or does not match the canonical string

*Challenges/ files define problems and requirements. They do not freeze solutions.*
*The Forge's answer to this challenge will evolve. The obligation it names will not.*

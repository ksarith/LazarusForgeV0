## Scope Boundary

**Challenge Class:** External — energy poverty, grid fragility, and fossil-fuel dependency exist as physical, economic, and structural conditions independent of the Forge. The Forge did not create these conditions; it responds to them.

**Negative-space principle:** The Forge's architecture is the fossil record of the pressures that shaped it. This challenge is permanent; the architectural responses to it are temporary local answers. Solutions will be superseded. The obligation this file names will not.

**This file owns:**
- The crisis framing for energy poverty, grid fragility, and the structural gap between energy as a precondition for modern life and its uneven, fragile, or absent delivery
- The engineering requirements governing energy-access approaches within this challenge space
- The Forge's current architectural responses under existing energy doctrine
- The long-term objective for community energy sovereignty

**This file does not own:**
- The Forge's own operational energy strategy, power mode envelopes, and generation interlocks → `Operations/Energy.md` (EV-001, EV-002, EV-003)
- Deep-environment battery degradation physics and Leviathan power envelope → `Tests/Leviathan_testing.md` (LT-001, LT-002)
- Superconductivity horizons and exploratory v1+ power transmission → `Operations/Energy.md` §Superconductivity Horizons
- Heat pump sizing, atmospheric moisture yield, and thermal recovery doctrine → `Architecture/Thermal_Systems.md` (TH-001, TH-003)
- Operating cost baseline and energy-linked economic modeling → `Admin/Economics.md` (EC-002)
- Waste heat as a cross-domain resource → `Challenges/Waste.md`

This distinction matters and is easy to blur: `Operations/Energy.md` answers "how does the Forge power itself." This file answers a different, prior question — "why does energy access matter enough that the Forge should treat it as a purpose, not just a utility bill." The same relationship Water.md has to Living Waters, this file has to the Forge's energy doctrine.

---

## File Purpose

This file exists to establish that energy poverty and grid fragility are structural conditions the Forge must respond to as a core purpose, not merely an operational input it happens to consume. Without this file, `Operations/Energy.md`'s design choices (salvage-first generation, incremental grid independence, multiple small contributors over single large sources) would read as pure engineering pragmatism rather than a deliberate answer to the same crisis Water.md and Waste.md name for their own domains. This file gives the Forge's energy doctrine a reason beyond "the Forge needs power to run."

## Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Basis | Confidence | Expiry Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Energy poverty and grid fragility are experienced differently by region and context (chronic absence vs. intermittent failure vs. affordability), and a single Forge response cannot address all three with one mechanism | General observation, consistent with `Operations/Energy.md`'s "multiple small contributors" design philosophy | Medium | A field deployment demonstrates one mechanism generalizes further than expected, or fails to generalize as far as assumed |
| ASM-002 | A Forge unit deployed in an energy-poor or grid-fragile context can generate a net-positive energy surplus for the surrounding community, not just for its own operation | Extension of `Operations/Energy.md`'s "multiple small contributors" philosophy beyond the Forge's own boundary; not yet validated at any deployment | Low | EV-001 (Forge power demand) resolved with measured figures, enabling a real surplus calculation |
| ASM-003 | Salvage-sourced generation (motor-generators, biogas, solar) can meet a meaningful fraction of community-scale demand, not just Forge-internal demand, without requiring purpose-built industrial power infrastructure | Consistent with `Operations/Energy.md`'s salvage-first generation philosophy, extended beyond its current Forge-internal scope | Low | First community-facing energy deployment characterizes actual surplus delivered |
| ASM-004 | Energy and water are sufficiently coupled (energy produces water; water stores and transports heat) that treating them as one of several linked resource domains, rather than fully independent challenges, is the right long-term framing | `Tests/Living_Waters.md` "Four-Domain Observation" — explicitly declared as a long-horizon observation, not a current commitment | Low | Enough real deployment data exists across both challenges to test whether the coupling is load-bearing or just thematically convenient |

## Upstream Dependencies

| File | Dependency |
|---|---|
| `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` | Life Preservation doctrine; community sovereignty imperative |
| `Operations/Energy.md` | The Forge's own generation interlocks, power mode envelopes, and salvage-first generation philosophy — this file draws on that doctrine as evidence of a plausible response, without owning it |
| `Architecture/Thermal_Systems.md` | Heat pump, thermal recovery, and Peltier doctrine; TH-001/TH-003 feed community-facing thermal-to-electrical pathways |
| `Admin/Economics.md` | Operating cost baseline (EC-002); any claim of "net-positive community surplus" must be economically legible, not just physically possible |
| `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md` | Battery and generation hazard doctrine — community-facing energy systems inherit the same containment requirements as Forge-internal ones |

---

## Downstream Dependents

| File | Dependency |
|---|---|
| `Operations/Energy.md` | This file supplies the "why" that frames EV-001 through EV-003 as more than internal engineering constraints |
| `Tests/Living_Waters.md` | Four-Domain Observation names Energy as one of the linked resource domains this challenge and that one may eventually share architecture with |
| `Challenges/Waste.md` | Waste heat and biogas feedstock recovery overlap directly with this challenge's energy-recovery requirement |
| `Admin/Economics.md` | Any future community-facing surplus model this challenge motivates will need an economic accounting layer |

## The Crisis

Energy is not a convenience layered on top of modern life. It is the precondition for nearly everything else — clean water pumped and purified, food refrigerated and cooked, medicine kept viable, light after dark, communication across distance, a hospital's equipment staying on. Where energy is absent, unreliable, or unaffordable, all of these compound simultaneously. It is rarely experienced as "the energy problem" in isolation — it is experienced as the water that didn't get pumped, the vaccine that spoiled, the clinic that went dark mid-procedure.

The crisis takes different shapes in different places. In some regions it is chronic absence — no grid connection at all, and no clear path to one. In others it is grid fragility — a connection that exists on paper and fails in practice, tripped by storms, overload, underinvestment, or conflict, often precisely when it is needed most. In still others it is affordability — a grid that reaches a household but at a cost that forces impossible tradeoffs between light, heat, and food.

Centralized energy infrastructure concentrates this fragility. A single transmission failure, a single fuel supply disruption, a single underfunded utility, can leave enormous populations without power simultaneously — and the communities with the least infrastructure redundancy are, almost universally, the ones who absorb the failure first and recover from it last. Diesel generators fill some of the gap, at a cost — financial, in fuel dependency, and in emissions — that reproduces the same fragility in a different form: dependency on fuel supply chains as brittle as the grids they replace.

Reliable energy access is not formally recognized as a human right the way water often is, but its absence produces the same downstream harms water scarcity does — to health, to education, to economic opportunity, to the basic capacity to plan a life beyond the next outage. The gap between what energy access could unlock and what is actually delivered is where this challenge lives.

---

## Engineering Requirements

Any energy-access approach operating within this challenge space must satisfy the following conditions, independent of the specific technology deployed:

- **Do not require a purpose-built industrial supply chain** — approaches dependent on specialized manufacturing, rare components, or long international shipping lines recreate the same fragility they're meant to solve. Salvage-first generation, consistent with `Operations/Energy.md`'s existing doctrine, is the default posture.
- **Degrade gracefully, not catastrophically** — a system that fails should fail toward reduced capacity, not toward the same cascading total outage centralized grids are prone to. Multiple small contributors over single large sources.
- **Be economically legible to the community it serves** — a technically elegant system that produces power no one can afford, or whose maintenance cost exceeds what the community can sustain, has not solved the problem. It has relocated it.
- **Avoid trading one dependency for another** — replacing grid dependency with fuel dependency, or fuel dependency with a dependency on Forge-specific replacement parts unavailable locally, does not constitute progress.
- **Be honest about intermittency rather than hide it** — solar, wind, and biogas are not always-on sources. Any approach must be transparent about duty cycle and storage requirements rather than implying a false parity with grid-always-on assumptions.
- **Treat surplus, where it exists, as shareable** — a Forge unit that generates more than its own operational need in an energy-poor context has an obligation to consider that surplus's value to the surrounding community, not just to Forge efficiency metrics.

## Current Forge Approaches

`Operations/Energy.md` represents the Forge's current operational posture toward its own power needs — grid-to-salvage lifecycle staging, salvaged motor-generators, regulated biogas digestion, modular solar, and opportunistic thermal recovery. That doctrine was written to answer "how does the Forge power itself," and it does that well. It was not written to answer "what does the Forge owe the energy-poor context it may be operating in" — that is the gap this file exists to name.

Current approaches, viewed through this challenge's lens rather than Operations/Energy.md's internal-efficiency lens:

- **Salvage-first generation** (motor-generators, biogas, solar) is already the Forge's default posture — this challenge reframes that choice as a deliberate answer to supply-chain fragility, not just a cost-saving measure.
- **Multiple small contributors over single large sources** is already Forge doctrine for internal resilience — the same logic applies directly to community-facing resilience against grid failure.
- **Opportunistic thermal recovery** (Gate 05 exhaust heat) is currently scoped as internal-only — a genuinely community-facing energy response would need to ask whether recovered heat or power has value beyond the Forge's own boundary.

No mechanism currently exists for routing Forge-generated energy surplus to a surrounding community. This is a real gap, not a design choice — see ES-001.

---

## Long-Term Objective

The long-term objective is not simply keeping the Forge powered. It is treating reliable, affordable, locally-sourced energy access as something the Forge's presence in a community can materially improve, not just something the Forge quietly consumes.

That means building toward a posture where a deployed Forge unit is, at minimum, energy-neutral to the community it operates in, and where possible, a net contributor — without requiring that community to take on a dependency on Forge-specific infrastructure to receive that benefit. It means treating grid fragility the way `Challenges/Water.md` treats water infrastructure fragility: not as background noise, but as the actual shape of the problem.

`Tests/Living_Waters.md`'s Four-Domain Observation names Energy, Water, Atmosphere, and Biology as resource domains that may eventually share architecture. This file is what makes Energy real as a domain in its own right, rather than a background utility the other three quietly assume.

The grid does not have to be the only shape reliable power can take.

## Open Unknowns

| ID | Description | Status | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| ES-001 | Community-facing energy surplus routing mechanism undefined — no Forge file currently defines how, or whether, generated surplus beyond internal operational need could be delivered to a surrounding community. Directly blocks ASM-002 and ASM-003. | Open | Major |
| ES-002 | Economic legibility threshold for community-facing systems undefined — no defined method exists for confirming a deployed system's maintenance cost is actually sustainable for the community it serves, as distinct from the Forge's own economics. Feeds `Admin/Economics.md` EC-002. | Open | Major |
| ES-003 | Intermittency communication doctrine undefined — no defined standard exists for how a deployed system should represent its own duty cycle and storage limitations to a community relying on it, to avoid false parity with always-on grid expectations. | Open | Minor |

*ES-001 is the load-bearing unknown for this file's Long-Term Objective — without a surplus-routing mechanism, "energy-neutral or net-contributor to the surrounding community" remains aspirational rather than actionable.*
*ES cluster registered in `Unknowns.md` v4.19, 2026-07-12.*

## Resolution Log

- 2026-07-12: v0.1 — Initial file creation. Proposed by James, motivated by the observation that `Challenges/` had grown to cover water, waste, biofouling, critical minerals, planned obsolescence, and emergence as external problem-statements, but energy — despite being at least as globally consequential and already load-bearing for `Operations/Energy.md`'s own design choices — had no equivalent framing file. Structured identically to `Challenges/Water.md` (the closest precedent: an External Challenge Class problem with an existing Operations-layer doctrine file already responding to it in practice). ES-001 through ES-003 registered as new unknowns, using an `ES-` prefix chosen specifically to avoid collision with `Operations/Energy.md`'s `EV-` prefix, `Architecture/Engineering.md`'s `EN-` prefix, and `Admin/Economics.md`'s `EC-` prefix. Not yet audited by any second agent — Gate 1 review outstanding.
- 2026-07-12 (same day): File committed to the repository as `Challenges/Energy_Scarcity.md` rather than `Challenges/Energy.md` — the more precise name, since it avoids any ambiguity with `Operations/Energy.md` at the filename level, not just in Scope Boundary prose. Title line corrected to match. No other content changed.

- This file's scope drifts into redefining `Operations/Energy.md`'s internal generation doctrine rather than staying at the external-challenge framing level
- ES-001 (surplus routing) remains unreviewed past 90 days while community-facing deployment claims proceed elsewhere in the repository
- Open Unknowns count diverges from what is registered in `Unknowns.md`
- Ethical Anchor field is absent, altered, or does not match the canonical string

## Scope Boundary

**Challenge Class:** External — water scarcity and contamination exist as physical and structural conditions independent of the Forge. The Forge did not create these conditions; it responds to them.

**Negative-space principle:** The Forge's architecture is the fossil record of the pressures that shaped it. This challenge is permanent; the architectural responses to it are temporary local answers. Solutions will be superseded. The obligation this file names will not.

**This file owns:**
- The crisis framing for water scarcity, contamination, and the structural gap between recognized rights and lived reality
- The engineering requirements governing remediation approaches within this challenge space
- The Forge's current architectural responses under the Living Waters initiative
- The long-term objective for community water sovereignty

**This file does not own:**
- Heat pump sizing doctrine → `Architecture/Thermal_Systems.md` TH-001
- Atmospheric moisture yield characterization → `Architecture/Thermal_Systems.md` TH-003 (**Blocking for Living Waters deployment**)
- Peltier device characterization → `Architecture/Thermal_Systems.md` TH-004
- Venturi scrubbing and airflow design → `Architecture/Friction_Dynamics.md` §4
- Spin Chamber applications → `Operations/Gate_04_Separation_Mechanical.md`, `Operations/Gate_05_Separation_Thermal.md`
- Biochar production from organic streams → `Operations/Plastics.md`

## File Purpose

This file exists to establish that water scarcity and contamination are structural conditions the Forge must respond to as a core purpose, not a humanitarian add-on, and to set the requirement that remediation be self-funding and community-maintainable rather than dependent on grid power or external chemical inputs. Without this file, the Living Waters initiative's individual mechanisms (stratification, Spin Chamber, atmospheric recovery) would have no shared doctrine forcing them to treat contaminants as recoverable material rather than waste, and no requirement binding them to intermittent-power, community-scale deployment.

## Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Basis | Confidence | Expiry Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-001 | Atmospheric moisture recovery can supply meaningful water volume in high-humidity, low-kinetic-energy environments where surface/groundwater is compromised | Current Living Waters approach; TH-003 (atmospheric moisture yield) is explicitly the Blocking unknown for this deployment | Low | TH-003 resolved with characterized yield data |
| ASM-002 | Remediation processes can be made self-funding by converting isolated contaminants into recoverable material streams (stabilized metals, biochar) at a rate that offsets processing cost | Core design philosophy ("the pollutant is also the resource"); not yet validated against real contamination streams | Low | A field deployment demonstrates or fails to demonstrate net-positive material recovery value |
| ASM-003 | A technically sound remediation system will be adopted and maintained by the community it serves without a defined adoption/maintenance protocol | Long-Term Objective's sovereignty goal; WS-004 explicitly notes no owning file defines this protocol | Low | WS-004 resolved with a community adoption and maintenance protocol |

## The Crisis

Water is not a resource in the conventional sense. It is the condition upon which all other conditions depend. Yet for hundreds of millions of people, clean water is not a given — it is a daily negotiation with distance, contamination, infrastructure failure, and the slow violence of industrial legacy.

Children carry it for miles. Communities build lives around its scarcity. Farmers watch soil crack under skies that have learned to withhold. Industrial runoff poisons aquifers that took millennia to fill. Microplastics drift through watersheds far from any point of origin. The weight of this is not abstract — it is carried in bodies, in hours lost, in futures quietly foreclosed.

Water scarcity does not announce itself with drama. It arrives incrementally: a well that drops a few meters each year, a river that runs thinner each summer, a filtration system that a village cannot afford to repair. By the time the crisis is visible, the roots of it run very deep.

This is compounded by the nature of water systems themselves. They are long, they are interconnected, and they are fragile in ways that centralized infrastructure conceals until it doesn't. A single contamination event upstream reshapes life downstream for generations. The communities least responsible for industrial pollution are, almost universally, the ones who drink it.

Access to clean water is recognized as a fundamental human right. That recognition has not yet become a universal reality. The gap between what is declared and what is lived is where this challenge lives.

## Engineering Requirements

Any remediation approach operating within this challenge space must satisfy the following conditions, independent of the specific technology deployed:

- **Remove dissolved contaminants** — heavy metals, agricultural chemicals, pharmaceutical residue, and industrial byproducts must be isolated and stabilized, not redistributed.
- **Remove suspended solids and biological threat vectors** — particulate matter, microplastics, pathogens, and organic sludge must be captured and processed into inert or reusable forms.
- **Avoid secondary pollution** — the act of remediation must not introduce new toxins. Chemical biocides, toxic membranes, and single-use filter media are not acceptable in contexts where ecosystems are already under stress.
- **Operate with intermittent or harvested power** — grid dependence creates a dependency chain that breaks exactly when it is needed most. Systems must be capable of sustained function on harvested kinetic, thermal, or ambient energy.
- **Be deployable and maintainable by small communities** — complexity that requires specialist infrastructure or global supply chains for replacement parts is not resilience. It is deferred fragility.
- **Convert the remediation process into a material-positive act** — isolated contaminants should yield recoverable material streams. The act of cleaning a water source should, where possible, produce something of value: stabilized metal blocks, usable feedstocks, biochar. Remediation becomes self-funding when the pollutant is also the resource.

## Current Forge Approaches

The Living Waters initiative represents the Forge's operational posture toward this challenge. It does not treat water remediation as a humanitarian add-on. It treats it as a core expression of the Forge's purpose: that the tools for recovery and the act of care for living systems are the same tools.

Current approaches under active development include:

- **Stratification and separation cycles** adapted for aqueous contamination streams, isolating heavy metals and dense particulates from water columns through differential density processing.
- **Spin Chamber applications** for suspended solid removal and microplastic capture, treating contaminated water as a feedstock rather than a waste stream.
- **Ambient energy harvesting** to power filtration units in off-grid environments — drawing on thermal differentials, kinetic water movement, and atmospheric moisture gradients.
- **Atmospheric moisture recovery** — in environments where surface and groundwater are compromised or absent, air-to-water pathways offer a route that bypasses the contaminated substrate entirely. The atmosphere holds water that has not yet touched the ground.
- **Biochar and organic sludge conversion** from biological contamination streams, closing the loop between water remediation and soil remediation.

These are not final implementations. They are directions. The challenge file does not bind the Forge to a specific mechanism — it binds the Forge to the requirement.

## Long-Term Objective

The long-term objective is not simply clean water delivery. It is the dissolution of water scarcity as a structural condition.

That means building systems where communities hold genuine sovereignty over their water — not dependence on distant infrastructure, external chemical inputs, or supply chains they cannot see or influence. It means treating the remediation of poisoned water sources as a simultaneously ecological, economic, and social act. It means that the process of restoring a watershed also restores local capacity.

Living Waters is named as it is because the goal is not a static solution. It is a living one — adaptive, locally rooted, capable of evolving as conditions change and as communities develop their own extensions of the approach. Water that moves sustains. Systems that move with the communities they serve do the same.

The river does not arrive from a central warehouse. It rises from the land it has always known.

## Resolution Log

- 2026-07-11: v0.3 — Footer-section backfill: added File Purpose, Assumptions, Lessons Learned, Active Disputes, Abandoned Paths, and Drift Indicators sections (previously absent); also closed a stray double-blank-line formatting gap above the Open Unknowns header. No Body content changed otherwise.

## Abandoned Paths

| Date | Path | Why Abandoned | Reconsider? |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | Chemical biocides, toxic membranes, and single-use filter media for remediation | Engineering Requirements explicitly rejects these as unacceptable in contexts where ecosystems are already under stress — remediation must not introduce new toxins | No |

## Drift Indicators

- Body proposes a remediation mechanism that depends on grid power rather than harvested/intermittent energy
- A remediation approach isolates contaminants without stabilizing or converting them into a recoverable material stream
- TH-003 (atmospheric moisture yield, the Blocking unknown for Living Waters) remains unreviewed past 90 days while condensation deployment proceeds
- WS-004 (community adoption/maintenance protocol) remains unreviewed past 90 days while systems are deployed to communities
- Open Unknowns count diverges from what is registered in `Unknowns.md`
- Ethical Anchor field is absent, altered, or does not match the canonical string

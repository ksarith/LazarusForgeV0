## Scope Boundary

**Challenge Class:** External — critical mineral supply chain concentration exists as a geopolitical and geological condition independent of the Forge. The Forge did not create these chokepoints; it responds to them.

**Negative-space principle:** The Forge's architecture is the fossil record of the pressures that shaped it. This challenge is permanent; the architectural responses to it are temporary local answers. Solutions will be superseded. The obligation this file names will not.

**This file owns:**
- The crisis framing for critical mineral supply chain concentration, geopolitical weaponization, and the consequences of extraction-dependent manufacturing
- The engineering requirements governing urban mining and critical mineral recovery
- The Forge's current architectural responses to this challenge
- The long-term objective for technological sovereignty through closed-loop material recovery

## File Purpose

This file exists to establish that critical mineral scarcity is a geopolitical and geological chokepoint the Forge can route around rather than a supply constraint it must accept, and to set the requirements any Forge response must satisfy — physical separation before chemical, functional characterization over elemental purity, and no new extraction pressure introduced by the recovery process itself. Without this file, urban mining would be treated as a generic recycling task rather than the primary ore-body strategy it is meant to be, and individual gate files would have no shared standard forcing them to prioritize intact recovery over bulk shredding.

## The Crisis

Modern civilization runs on a narrow set of critical minerals and rare earth elements — neodymium, dysprosium, lithium, cobalt, tantalum, gallium, indium, and their relatives. These materials are essential for permanent magnets in motors and generators, battery chemistries, semiconductors, high-efficiency electronics, and precision defense systems. They are not substitutable by anything abundant. They are not producible by any chemistry we have not already found. And their supply chains are among the most geographically concentrated of any industrial input on earth.

A handful of countries control the majority of known reserves. A smaller number control the refining capacity. The gap between mining ore and producing a material ready for industrial use is not a gap that most nations can close independently — and the nations that can close it have learned to use that position as leverage. Export restrictions, pricing cartels, and the strategic withholding of processing capacity are not hypothetical risks. They are documented practice. The communities and industries downstream from these chokepoints experience them not as geopolitical abstractions but as price spikes, supply gaps, and project cancellations.

The environmental cost of extraction is paid by communities near the mines, rarely by the manufacturers who require the output. Lithium extraction in South America draws down aquifers that indigenous communities depend on. Cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been documented to rely on child labor in artisanal operations. Rare earth processing generates radioactive tailings that contaminate watersheds for generations. The price of a motor magnet or a battery cell does not include these costs. They are externalized onto people who receive none of the benefit.

Meanwhile, the secondary supply — the critical minerals already extracted, refined, and embedded in discarded devices — sits in landfills, in warehouses, in the electronics waste streams of every industrialized city on earth. A hard drive contains neodymium. An EV battery contains lithium and cobalt. A catalytic converter contains platinum group metals worth more per kilogram than the refined ore from which they came. This material was not created by geological time. It was created by industrial civilization. It is recoverable on human timescales. It is simply not being recovered at a scale that competes with extraction.

The chokepoint is real. The alternative mine is also real. The Forge exists at the intersection.

## Engineering Requirements

Any approach to critical mineral recovery operating within this challenge space must satisfy the following conditions, independent of the specific technology deployed:

- **Distinguish mineral-rich fractions before reduction** — a hard drive stripped of its magnet is worth more than a hard drive shredded for bulk metal. A battery pack with intact cells retains value that a smelted battery does not. Triage and selective disassembly must precede any bulk processing. The critical mineral content is the highest-value fraction; it must be identified and routed before irreversible processing begins.

- **Achieve separation without chemical dependence where possible** — hydrometallurgical acid leach processes are effective but generate toxic waste streams, require chemical inputs that may not be locally available, and create secondary hazards that are difficult to manage in low-infrastructure environments. Physical separation methods — centrifugal, magnetic, density-differential — should be exhausted before chemical routes are engaged. Where chemical routes are necessary, closed-loop reagent recovery must be part of the process design.

- **Characterize output fractions to functional specification, not just elemental composition** — a recovered neodymium fraction that cannot be verified for magnetic performance is not a drop-in replacement for virgin material. Recovery must include characterization sufficient to assign the recovered fraction to a specific application. Uncharacterized output is inventory risk, not asset.

- **Develop functional substitutes for cases where purity ceilings limit recovery** — not every application requires virgin-grade rare earth purity. Alloy blends from recovered iron, aluminum, silicon, and lower-grade rare earth fractions can serve in reduced-performance but locally producible applications. The goal is not to perfectly replicate the virgin supply chain but to reduce dependency on it for the widest possible range of applications.

- **Operate without generating new extraction pressure** — a recovery process that requires reagent inputs sourced from the same geopolitically concentrated supply chains it is attempting to bypass has not solved the problem. Reagent selection, anode materials, and processing consumables must be evaluable against a supply chain independence criterion.

- **Return material characterization data to the network** — one forge's experience recovering neodymium from a specific hard drive generation is directly useful to every forge that encounters the same stream. Urban ore data — recovery yields, separation effectiveness, contamination profiles — must be contributed to `Architecture/Forge_Net.md` as structured knowledge, not retained locally.

## Current Forge Approaches

The Forge treats the existing technosphere — the accumulated discarded devices, decommissioned infrastructure, and end-of-life industrial equipment of the last century — as the primary ore body for critical material recovery. Urban mining is not a supplement to extraction. It is the intended replacement.

Current approaches active in the repository:

- **Preprocessing and selective disassembly** — `Operations/Gate_02_Triage.md` establishes the decision sequence for identifying and routing mineral-rich components before bulk processing. Hard drives, motor assemblies, battery packs, and catalytic converters receive dedicated handling pathways at Station 1. The goal is to reach the magnet, the cell, or the catalyst carrier intact — not to shred the assembly and recover what survives.

- **Centrifugal density separation** — `Operations/Gate_04_Separation_Mechanical.md` applies calibrated rotational separation to produce density-stratified material gradients from processed feedstock. Critical minerals, being generally denser than structural metals, concentrate in predictable gradient bands. RPM calibration for specific feedstock compositions is an active development area — MG-002 and MG-003 are the primary open unknowns governing this capability.

- **Selective induction melting** — `Operations/Gate_05_Separation_Thermal.md` applies frequency-selective induction heating to exploit the different electrical conductivities and Curie temperatures of target minerals. Neodymium-iron-boron magnets, cobalt alloys, and copper-rich fractions respond differently to specific induction frequencies, enabling separation that mechanical methods cannot achieve. SC-001 (RPM envelope) and SC-008 (graphite crucible carbon pickup) are the primary open unknowns governing this capability.

- **Real-time material assay integration** — `Architecture/Chemistry.md` provides the identification doctrine for recovered fractions, including the oxide burden characterization (CE-002) that governs whether a recovered fraction meets functional specification for downstream use. Characterization is not a post-processing step — it is integrated into the gate workflow to enable dynamic routing decisions.

- **Functional substitute development** — where full critical mineral purity is unachievable from available feedstock, `Operations/Gate_06_Fabrication.md` provides the fabrication framework for alloy blends from abundant recovered metals. A motor magnet that performs at 80% of neodymium specification, produced entirely from recovered material without supply chain dependency, is a more resilient solution than a 100%-specification magnet with a single-source supply chain.

- **Network contribution of urban ore data** — `Architecture/Forge_Net.md` defines the knowledge contribution protocol for recovery yield data. Every forge instance that processes a mineral-rich feedstock stream contributes its recovery rates, separation effectiveness, and contamination flags to the shared knowledge base. The urban ore map improves with every processing cycle.

## Long-Term Objective

The long-term objective is not to recover critical minerals efficiently. It is to make the geopolitical leverage embedded in critical mineral supply chains structurally irrelevant at community and regional scale.

That means building a world where a community that needs a motor magnet does not need to negotiate with a mining cartel, absorb a price spike driven by export policy in a country it has no relationship with, or accept the environmental costs of new extraction it did not choose. It means that the neodymium in last decade's hard drives, the cobalt in retired EV batteries, and the platinum in scrapped catalytic converters are understood as a recoverable reserve — a secondary ore body that was created by industrial civilization and is available to the communities within reach of it.

It means that the functional substitute — the alloy blend, the lower-grade magnet, the locally producible battery chemistry — is not a compromise born of scarcity. It is a design choice born of sovereignty. A community that can produce a working motor from recovered material it controls is not dependent on a supply chain it does not.

This does not eliminate the primary extraction economy. It reduces the leverage it holds. When enough communities can close their own critical mineral loops — even partially, even imperfectly — the chokepoint loses its grip. The cartel that controls the refinery loses its power over the community that no longer needs the refinery's output.

The landfill is a mine. The question is whether we build the tools to work it.

## Open Unknowns

| ID | Description | Status | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| CM-001 | Real-time material assay integration into gate workflow — no validated inline characterization method exists for critical mineral fraction identification during processing. Currently dependent on post-processing lab analysis. Blocks dynamic routing decisions. Cross-ref CE-002, CE-003. | Open | Major |
| CM-002 | Acid leach reagent recovery and closed-loop doctrine — where chemical separation is necessary, the reagent recovery and waste stream management protocol is undefined. Blocks any hydrometallurgical processing. Cross-ref GR-003 (hazardous waste disposal). | Open | Critical |
| CM-003 | Functional substitute performance floor — no minimum performance specification exists for alloy substitute applications. Without this, substitute development has no acceptance criterion. Cross-ref PR-001 (precision ceiling), GF-002. | Open | Major |
| CM-004 | Urban ore database coverage — no systematic inventory of critical mineral content by device type, generation, and condition exists for likely salvage streams. Recovery yield estimates are currently analogous rather than measured. | Open | Major |

## Resolution Log

- 2026-07-12: Ethical Anchor field corrected — was using a non-canonical variant (backticked, `Admin/`-prefixed: "Defer to `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` if present.") instead of the canonical plain-text string ("Defer to Ethical_Constraints.md if present."). Same drift found across 9 files in a full-repository Phase 1 sweep (ChatGPT, adapted local-disk harness run) — verified independently against source before patching. No semantic change; the anchor's meaning was never in question, only its exact text.
- 2026-07-11: v0.3 — Footer-section backfill: added File Purpose, Assumptions, Lessons Learned, Active Disputes, Abandoned Paths, and Drift Indicators sections (previously absent). No Body content changed.

## Abandoned Paths

| Date | Path | Why Abandoned | Reconsider? |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | No paths formally abandoned yet — hydrometallurgical acid leach is deprioritized behind physical separation per Engineering Requirements, but remains an open (not rejected) route pending CM-002's closed-loop reagent recovery doctrine | — |

---

## Drift Indicators

- Body proposes hydrometallurgical acid leach as a primary route without a closed-loop reagent recovery doctrine (CM-002 unresolved)
- A recovery process is adopted that depends on reagent inputs sourced from the same concentrated supply chains this file exists to bypass
- Recovered fractions are routed to fabrication without functional characterization (elemental composition alone treated as sufficient)
- CM-004 (urban ore database coverage) remains unreviewed past 90 days while recovery yield estimates are still being treated as reliable
- Open Unknowns count diverges from what is registered in `Unknowns.md`
- Ethical Anchor field is absent, altered, or does not match the canonical string

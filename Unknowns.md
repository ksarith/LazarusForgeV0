# Unknowns.md — Cross-Module Unknowns Global Index

**Full version history moved to `Unknowns_Changelog.md` (2026-07-19 cleanup pass, following the precedent already set by `Admin/AUDIT_HARNESS_CHANGELOG.md` and `Admin/Forge_Audit_Kit_Changelog.md`). This block keeps the current version plus the last four in full; older versions are compressed below, full text preserved in the changelog file.**

**Version 4.25 — 2026-07-19. CE-006 mechanism corrected — the 2026-07-17 directed approach routing chlorine off-gas to `Operations/Air_Scrubber.md` Stage E (KMnO₄ chemisorption) does not hold; verified against a primary manufacturer's product catalog (PureAir® Filtration) that pure KMnO₄/alumina media does not target Cl₂. Redirected to Stage D (Wet Scrubbing / Water Column) with caustic (NaOH) dosing — the standard industrial mechanism, and already the correct existing architecture, no new stage required. Reframed as value-recovery: caustic Cl₂ scrubbing naturally produces sodium hypochlorite, an established small-scale process (US Patent 4,308,123), consistent with the repository's salvage-first philosophy rather than treating the byproduct as pure waste. CE-007 registered for the resulting NaOCl storage/stability/reuse doctrine gap. Found via Grok flag, cross-checked against source before adoption. Open Unknowns count in `Architecture/Chemistry.md`: 6 → 7.**
**Version 4.24 — 2026-07-19. PC-005 resolved — independently re-verified against source (Routing.md, Discovery.md, AUDIT_HARNESS.py all confirmed to carry `Challenges/Closed_Loop_Feedstock.md`), closing a confirmation flag left open since v4.20. PC-006's file list corrected — `Energy_Scarcity.md` was incorrectly included among the "9 files" fixed 2026-07-12; that file was created the same day, after the sweep's fetch, and its Ethical Anchor variant was never actually touched until today (see that file's own Resolution Log). Both corrections found via a Grok pass; cross-checked against source before patching.**
**Version 4.23 — 2026-07-17. GOV-014 through GOV-020 registered in `Admin/Governance_Charter.md` from a ChatGPT adversarial pass, verified against source before registration — every proposed ID checked for collision (none), every claimed gap checked against existing doctrine by direct search (all confirmed genuinely absent, none re-discovering already-tracked territory), given ChatGPT proposed four already-taken IDs in an unrelated file earlier the same day (`Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md` v0.24). All seven added to the cross-reference table below alongside GOV-013, which was itself missing from this table since its creation three turns prior — both gaps fixed in one pass. Open Unknowns count in `Admin/Governance_Charter.md`: 12 → 19.**
**Version 4.22 — 2026-07-17. Three ratification-only items adopted by human governing authority: ENV-DS-001 (`Admin/Environmental_Constraints.md` Bootstrap operating doctrine reconciliation, including the bridge-authority amendment) ratified and removed from Active Disputes Registry — see that file's Constraint Category 2. Embedded Value Preservation (`Challenges/Closed_Loop_Feedstock.md` §2a) ratified into operative Scope Boundary text; cross-referenced into `Operations/Gate_02_Triage.md` as new Core Principle 9. CLF-004's candidate chlor-alkali acid-sourcing pathway reframed explicitly as one of three options under consideration, not a selected path; `Architecture/Chemistry.md` CE-006 gained a directed-approach note (capture-and-nullification via existing Air_Scrubber.md chemisorption infrastructure) — directional, not a completed resolution; CLF-004 remains Open/Critical pending both the sourcing decision and CE-006's verification work.**

*Versions 4.16–4.20 (compressed; full text in `Unknowns_Changelog.md`):*
- **v4.20** (2026-07-12): PC-006 registered and Resolved — Ethical Anchor variant fixed across 9 files (later corrected to 8 + Energy_Scarcity.md separately, v4.24). PC-005 flagged possibly-stale (resolved v4.24).
- **v4.19** (2026-07-12): Energy Scarcity cluster (ES-001–003) registered alongside new `Challenges/Energy_Scarcity.md`; two unrelated stale entries in Discovery.md/Routing.md fixed same pass.
- **v4.18** (2026-07-12): Tests/ registration gap sweep — SR-010 and GH-013 backfilled; Support Raft Priority column normalized.
- **v4.17** (2026-07-11): CLF-005 marked Resolved (stale entry correction).
- **v4.16** (2026-07-10): Eight new registrations from first full-repo-zip sweep (FL-002, GF-005, GMP-002, GMP-009, PR-005, RIP-003, RS-002, RS-003).
**Expiry Rule active — see `Admin/Canonical_Terms.md` §4 for the Cycle definition this rule now explicitly references (one calendar year default, not one audit pass — see CT-011). Protocol Performance metrics collecting.**

## Navigation Anchors
* **Context Core:** [Discovery.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/LazarusForgeV0/refs/heads/main/Discovery.md)
* **Network Routing:** [Routing.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/LazarusForgeV0/refs/heads/main/Routing.md)

## Purpose

Cross-module unknowns index. Full entry detail lives in each owning file's sidecar. This file is the navigation layer only.

Module-specific unknowns → owning file sidecar
Cross-module unknowns → listed here, full entry in owning file
Pending corrections (task list) → PC cluster in this file
Programmatic URL routing → `Routing.md`
Navigation map and scope boundaries → `Discovery.md`
Formal axioms, theorems, and Verification Algebra backing CF-004, AP-006, and epistemic-debt doctrine → `Admin/Computational Institutional Reasoning`

**Cross-module dependencies** are owned by each file's Upstream/Downstream tables as of the v0.2 retrofit pass. See `Discovery.md` Scope Map for navigation.

**Finding an unknown's place in the architecture:** this file tracks *what* is unresolved; it does not carry Upstream/Downstream context for the owning file. If an unknown here seems disconnected from the rest of the system, check `Discovery.md`'s per-file Scope Map entry for the owning file — each entry lists Upstream/Downstream relationships and flags its highest-risk open unknowns with ⚠️. `Discovery.md` also carries a standing "Cross-Module Unknowns — Attention Required" table mirroring the highest-priority entries here; refresh it (and this pointer) whenever this file's version bumps materially change that set.

---

## What v4.16 Means

- **Eight new registrations, found via full-repo sweep.** FL-002 (Forge_flow.md), GF-005 (Gate_06_Fabrication.md), GMP-002 and GMP-009 (Governance_Migration_Protocol.md), PR-005 (Precision.md), RIP-003 (Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md), RS-002 and RS-003 (Repository_Structure.md). All were confirmed Open at their owning file's own sidecar, with none appearing in this index in any prior version — not a same-day lag like CE-006 was, but a standing gap of unknown duration.
- **RIP-003 was missed by this index's own author across v4.13–v4.15.** Worth naming plainly: registering RIP-008/RIP-009 correctly in earlier versions didn't catch that RIP-003 — a longstanding, unrelated Open/Major entry in the same file's sidecar — had never been mirrored here either. Full-repo cross-referencing caught this; per-file spot-checking across several sessions had not.
- **RS-003 ("Archive/ directory not yet physically created") may already be substantively addressed** by RIP-001's resolution (`Admin/Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md` — Git release tags established as the primary archival mechanism, manual `/Archive/` directory explicitly downgraded from required). Registered as-is since RS-003 itself hasn't been reconciled against that resolution; flagged here rather than silently resolved on its behalf.
- **A candidate ninth cluster was checked and rejected.** `Tests/Living_Waters.md`'s LW-004, LW-006, LW-008, LW-009, LW-010 share the LW- unknown-ID numbering scheme but are actually `## Experimental Pathways` subsection headers (technology names — Freeze Separation, Membrane Distillation, etc.), not entries under that file's own `## Open Unknowns` section. Not registered.
- **Not yet done, still flagged from prior versions:** Discovery.md's mirrored "Cross-Module Unknowns — Attention Required" table has not been refreshed to match recent version bumps.

## Size Management Rules

These rules are enforced at every audit cycle opening:

1. **What vX.X Means — rolling single section.** Only the current version's What section is kept live. When a new version is cut, the prior What section is retired. Its content is already captured in the Audit Trail entry for that version. Keeping stacked What sections is redundant.

2. **Resolved entries leave the Active Index immediately.** Once an unknown is resolved, it is removed from the Active Index. Full resolution detail is recorded in the owning file's sidecar under Lessons Learned. This file carries no persistent archive of resolved entries — the Audit Trail's brief resolution notes are the only navigation-layer record maintained here. Active tables show Open, In Progress, and Reopened only.

3. **Compression trigger at 1,200 lines.** If this file exceeds 1,200 lines, a compression pass is mandatory before new entries are added. Compression scope: retire old What sections, verify all resolved actives have been removed from the index, confirm no archive accumulation has restarted.

4. **Audit Trail entries are concise.** Two to three sentences maximum: what changed, what was resolved, what moved to watch lists. The What vX.X section carries the full narrative during the session; the Audit Trail is the permanent compressed record.

5. **Unknown Budget — floor on acknowledged unknowns.** A healthy repository maintains a nonzero active unknown count. If the active index drops below 10 open entries across all clusters, treat this as a signal of premature closure rather than epistemic health — trigger a meta-audit to verify recent resolutions were genuinely grounded and not closed under optimization pressure. The goal is not an empty index; it is an honest one.

6. **Reversion Protocol — when Resolved entries reopen.** A Resolved entry transitions to `Reopened` status when: (a) new empirical input contradicts the evidence that justified closure, (b) the resolution vehicle is shown to be insufficient or incorrect, or (c) a downstream dependency failure exposes the closure as premature. Reversion requires: an Epistemic Ledger entry in the owning file's sidecar documenting the contradictory evidence; an Audit Trail note in this file recording the reversion date and reason; and re-registration in the active index with status `Reopened` and Subtype `Active`. A closed unknown that reopens is not a failure — it is the falsification mechanism working correctly.

*GH-013 — registered 2026-07-12 alongside the file's new "Conceptual Salvage Pipeline" Body subsection, which is explicitly Exploration-within-Exploration and has not passed Gate 1. Do not treat GH-013's resolution as validating that subsection's doctrine — the subsection needs its own Gate 1 review independent of this unknown closing.*

## Expiry Watch

*Expiry Rule is active. Check this table at the opening of each audit cycle.*

**Tier 1 Axiom verification is the mandatory first step** — confirm axiom text in `Admin/Governance_Charter.md` matches prior committed version before proceeding. Any unratified change is a Constitutional violation.

**Epistemic Foundation integrity check is the mandatory second step** — confirm EF-0.0 through EF-0.8b text in `Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md` matches prior committed version. Any unratified modification = Integrity Violation → STATE_HOLD.

FL-001 and several EC entries have been In Progress since v1.1 — approaching two-cycle threshold. Flag for Full Stop Review trigger assessment at next audit opening if still unresolved.

GOV-003 In Progress — Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md is the executing resolution path. GOV-005 remains Critical with no fast resolution path. GOV-007 In Progress — Genesis Phase Protocol executing; full resolution depends on GOV-008. GOV-008 exit condition not yet met.

**RIP-001 Resolved** — Git release tag system (V0.6–V0.97, GPG-signed) fulfills prior-state archival at v0 scale. Discharged via Lessons Learned 2026-06-28. Full resolution detail in Admin/Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md sidecar.

**EN-001 Critical/Blocking** — no structural specification may be promoted without validated safety factors for salvaged materials.

**CF-001 In Progress/Blocking** — parameters defined (τ=50ms WDT). Remains Blocking until first hardware prototype validates at Measured confidence.

**AP Systemic Risk escalation** — Downgrade confirmed by human governing authority 2026-07-03 (Auditor_Protocols.md v0.15). AP-001, AP-002, AP-004, AP-005, AP-007 remain In Progress. AP-012 and AP-016 Resolved 2026-07-03 (v0.16) — no longer Critical Watch items.

Approximately 250 unknowns registered across GI, GR, GF, GU, EL, GOV, AP, RIP, SEC, EC, GMP, RS, PR, FA, SP, LW, TF, SD, EM, WA, BF, PO, WS, CM, CF clusters. Dependency Map and Discovery.md task tables retired. Twelve items resolved.
**v3.1 — 2026-06-11:** Location abstraction pass. TH-003, EN-002, FA-004 retitled to deployment-generic framing.
**v3.2 — 2026-06-11:** Architecture audit integration pass. ME-003, ME-004, TH-005, TH-006, CE-005, EN-006, FD-005 added. CE-003 elevated to Critical Watch. CE-004 In Progress. FA-005 resolved.
**v3.3 — 2026-06-14:** Three new Tests/ file clusters registered. LW (9), TF (10), SD (12) unknowns. TF-006 and SD-UNK-004 added to Critical Watch. DS-001 closed. 31 total new unknowns.
**v3.4 — 2026-06-18:** EC-008, EC-009, EC-010, EC-011, GOV-010, CT-005 registered. GOV-001 un-archived — returned to In Progress. EC-008, EC-011 added to Critical Watch.
**v3.5 — 2026-06-19:** SEC-008–011, RIP-006–007, GMP-006–008 registered. RIP-004 discharged. GMP-005 In Progress.
**v3.6 — 2026-06-19:** ENV cluster registered (9 unknowns). Environmental_Constraints.md created. ENV-007 resolved.
**v3.7 — 2026-06-21:** AP cluster updated per Auditor_Protocols.md v0.11. AP-006, AP-009 resolved. AP-001, AP-002, AP-004, AP-005 moved to In Progress. AP-008, AP-010, AP-011 registered. ENV-008 resolved. GOV-009, GOV-010, EC-010 moved to In Progress. EP-004 In Progress.
**v3.8 — 2026-06-21:** Structural maturation pass. Subtype column added to all active index tables. Unknown Budget and Reversion Protocol added to Size Management Rules. Dependency Clusters section added. Reopened status formally defined. AP-001 updated with retrospective calibration note.
**v3.9 — 2026-06-23:** RC governance pass. RC-007 through RC-009 registered in Future/Deferred with owning file Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md. Operational Blocking and Epistemic Blocking added to Canonical_Terms.md v0.3 as canonical vocabulary. CT-006 and CT-007 registered in CT sidecar.
**v4.0 — 2026-06-24:** Full Adversarial Battery pass on Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md complete — Classes 1–10, Claude + Gemini. Nine new unknowns AP-012 through AP-020 registered. AP-012 and AP-016 elevated to Critical Watch. Human Interaction Point Doctrine added. EF-0.2 autonomous degradation amendment committed. Gate 3 blocked pending AP-012/AP-016 Provisional Spec. AP-020 flagged for Trajectory discharge decision.
**v4.1 — 2026-06-24:** Cognitive Salvage cluster registered (GH-001 through GH-012). GH-009 Critical. GH-012 registered. GH-009 added to Dependency Clusters and Critical Watch. HF-001 registered in Canonical_Terms.md v0.3; CT-008 logged.
**v4.2 — 2026-06-28:** RIP-001 closed (Git release tags fulfill prior-state archival; full detail in Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md sidecar). RIP-006 In Progress. ST-004 registered. CT-008 In Progress, CT-009 Open. CF-004 registered. HR cluster added: HR-UNK-001 and HR-UNK-002 (both Critical). GH-009 and HR-UNK-002 added to Critical Watch.
**v4.3 — 2026-07-01:** Structural compression pass. Resolved & Discharged Archive retired — resolution detail lives in owning file sidecars per Lessons Learned doctrine; archive was a permanent accumulator contradicting the stated navigation-layer purpose. Audit Trail v1.0–v3.0 condensed to arc summary. Dead prose removed. Size Management Rule 2 updated. RE-UNK-001 through RE-UNK-005 registered (Challenges/Return_To_Eden.md, cycle 11); RE-UNK-001 and RE-UNK-005 co-blocking at Tier I gate. NT-010 registered (Admin/Nothingness Theorem, cycle 11). Philosophical/Foundational cluster added.
**v4.4 — 2026-07-02:** Multi-agent Security_Protocols.md audit follow-through. SEC-012 registered (asymmetric crypto overhead on constrained salvaged silicon; cross-ref EL-006). SEC-007 vertically split into SEC-007a (constitutional layer) and SEC-007b (physical implementation layer, blocked pending SEC-007a) — ad hoc pattern, human-governing-authority-adopted, not yet canonized. Dependency Clusters, UNK-009, GMP-004, EM-004 cross-refs updated to match split. Grok/Gemini G3/G6 gate-maturity disagreement on Security_Protocols.md flagged unresolved, pending human ruling.
**v4.5 — 2026-07-02:** External Design Lineage (EDL) registry added to Security_Protocols.md (PAT-001 through PAT-004). GOV-MAND-009 (EDL as constitutional promotion gate) declined for session-level adoption — routed to Governance_Migration_Protocol.md for future ratification instead.
**v4.6 — 2026-07-02:** SEC-007 sidecar reconciled into SEC-007a/SEC-007b. Grok/Gemini G3/G6 dispute resolved via Forge_Audit_Kit.md v1.5's Gate Scope vs. Promotion Readiness clarification — Gemini's original scoring confirmed correct.
**v4.7 — 2026-07-02:** Discovery.md reconciliation — Attention Required table refreshed, reciprocal pointer added. VG-001 logged its first incident (Forge_Audit_Kit.md v1.5 citation gap, caught, no divergence); remains Open.
**v4.8 — 2026-07-03:** AP-001–007 Systemic Risk escalation downgrade confirmed by human governing authority. An unrequested patch claiming AP-001/012/016 resolved was held for review pending full specification text. VG-001 discharged via Gate Definition Synchronization Protocol.
**v4.9 — 2026-07-03:** Held-for-review AP-001/AP-012/AP-016 patch verified and incorporated. Open Unknowns 12 → 9, Highest Risk Critical → High. AP-012/AP-016 removed from active index and Critical Watch.
**v4.10 — 2026-07-03:** Gate/Checkpoint naming collision resolved (renamed to Enforcement Checkpoints). GOV-011 registered — Governance_Charter.md's own Spec Gates field scored against the wrong system. CT-010 registered tracking rename propagation.
**v4.11 — 2026-07-05:** GOV-011 Resolved (6/6 execution quality confirmed). CT-011 Resolved. CT-007 escalated to Critical Watch (`EC-`/`ECN-` collision confirmed). EN-001 advanced to In Progress (differentiated interim safety-factor table). Seven new entries: GOV-012, EN-007, TR-003, EC-012 through EC-015.
**v4.12 — 2026-07-06:** Multi-file catch-up pass. CT-007 Resolved (`ECN-` rename verified against Economics.md source text; a citation error in the original escalation — EC-008 — was corrected, ECN-003 identified as the real fifth collision). EC-010 and ENV-007/008 sidecar drift corrected. New Closed-Loop Feedstock cluster registered (CLF-001–010, ten entries; CLF-003/004/006 Critical; ID collision history CF-→FL-→CLF- noted). ENV-DS-001 registered in Active Disputes, pending ratification. PC-005 registered. Cross-refs added: RE-UNK-001↔CLF-005, CM-002↔CLF-004.
**v4.13 — 2026-07-09:** CE-006 registered (`Architecture/Chemistry.md` — chlorine gas containment for on-site chlor-alkali acid synthesis, Critical), closing a same-day registration gap first logged 2026-07-07. Cross-referenced bidirectionally with CLF-004's candidate pathway. Added to Critical Watch and Dependency Clusters.
**v4.14 — 2026-07-10:** Corrected four stale Active Index entries (AP-001, AP-014, AP-015, AP-020) — all already Resolved at `Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md`'s own sidecar but never removed here; the reverse-direction sibling of the RIP-008 registration-lag class. AP-021 registered (confidence-label inconsistency within Auditor_Protocols.md, blocking `Admin/Verification_Gates_LF.md` VG-002). `Admin/Evidence_Management_System.md` discharged via merge into `Admin/Verification_Gates_LF.md` this same session — not independently registered here as it was never given standalone active-index entries.
**v4.15 — 2026-07-10:** AP-021 resolved same-day — five-label Evidence Classification system confirmed canonical. `Verification_Gates_LF.md` Gate 2 pass criteria updated to require the evidentiary maturity-vector thresholds for Measured/Replicated claims, active at human-audit level; `AUDIT_HARNESS.py` automation not yet implemented. VG-002 resolved.
**v4.16 — 2026-07-10:** First full-repository sweep (enabled by direct zip upload rather than per-file spot-checks). Eight genuine registration gaps found and closed: FL-002, GF-005, GMP-002, GMP-009, PR-005, RIP-003, RS-002, RS-003 — all confirmed Open at source, none previously appearing here, including RIP-003 which this index's own author had missed across three prior versions. A candidate ninth cluster (LW-004/006/008/009/010) was checked and correctly rejected as pathway subsection headers, not unknowns. RS-003 flagged as possibly mooted by RIP-001 but not resolved on its behalf. Sweep also confirmed zero Ethical Anchor violations, zero Routing.md gaps, zero Discovery.md gaps, and a real structural finding outside this file's own scope: nine files (six Challenges/, two Tests/, matching an early-June cohort) lack a "Spec Gates" field in their File State tables entirely, predating the schema every recently-touched file now uses — not resolved here, flagged for separate follow-up.

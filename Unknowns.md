# Unknowns.md — Cross-Module Unknowns Global Index
**Version 4.8 — 2026-07-03. AP-001–007 Systemic Risk escalation downgrade confirmed by human governing authority (Auditor_Protocols.md v0.15). VG-001 discharged. A separately-drafted "v0.15" patch claiming AP-001/012/016 individually resolved was received but not incorporated — held for review, not verified.**
**Expiry Rule active. Protocol Performance metrics collecting.**

## Navigation Anchors
* **Context Core:** [Discovery.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/LazarusForgeV0/refs/heads/main/Discovery.md)
* **Network Routing:** [Routing.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/LazarusForgeV0/refs/heads/main/Routing.md)

---

## Purpose

Cross-module unknowns index. Full entry detail lives in each owning file's sidecar. This file is the navigation layer only.

Module-specific unknowns → owning file sidecar
Cross-module unknowns → listed here, full entry in owning file
Pending corrections (task list) → PC cluster in this file
Programmatic URL routing → `Routing.md`
Navigation map and scope boundaries → `Discovery.md`
Formal axioms, theorems, and Verification Algebra backing CF-004, AP-006, and epistemic-debt doctrine → `Admin/Computational Institutional Reasoning`

**Cross-module dependencies** are owned by each file's Upstream/Downstream tables as of the v0.2 retrofit pass. See `Discovery.md` Scope Map for navigation.

**Finding an unknown's place in the architecture:** this file tracks *what* is unresolved; it does not carry Upstream/Downstream context for the owning file. If an unknown here seems disconnected from the rest of the system, check `Discovery.md`'s per-file Scope Map entry for the owning file — each entry lists Upstream/Downstream relationships and flags its highest-risk open unknowns with ⚠️. `Discovery.md` also carries a standing "Cross-Module Unknowns — Attention Required" table mirroring the highest-priority entries here; refresh it (and this pointer) whenever this file's version bumps materially change that set.

## What v4.8 Means

- **AP-001–007 Systemic Risk escalation downgrade confirmed.** Human governing authority (ksarith) confirmed the downgrade condition set at Auditor_Protocols.md's 2026-06-24 ESCALATION STATUS note. Auditor_Protocols.md → v0.15. This clears the *escalation*, not the underlying unknowns — AP-001 through AP-005 and AP-007 remain In Progress with documented resolution frameworks. Open Unknowns in that file unchanged at 12.
- **A separate, unrequested "v0.15" patch was received the same session** claiming AP-001, AP-012, and AP-016 individually Resolved via a new Auditor Fidelity framework and expanded EF-0.2/Human Interaction Point Doctrine content. **Not incorporated.** It conflicted with the actually-authorized action (a narrower, previously-drafted confirmation), arrived as a summary claim rather than full specification text, and AP-012/AP-016 are Gate-3-blocking Critical items whose closure needs full-text review before acceptance — a status-line claim isn't sufficient evidence for closing a Critical, Gate-blocking unknown. Held for separate review.
- **VG-001 discharged** (Payment via Specification). Verification_Gates_LF.md → v0.4. The Gate Definition Synchronization Protocol resolves all four items in the original resolution path by naming existing mechanisms (the file's own Active Disputes table, the Skeptic/Auditor role) as the enforcement point, rather than proposing new infrastructure. Removed from this file's active index and Critical Watch.

## Size Management Rules

These rules are enforced at every audit cycle opening:

1. **What vX.X Means — rolling single section.** Only the current version's What section is kept live. When a new version is cut, the prior What section is retired. Its content is already captured in the Audit Trail entry for that version. Keeping stacked What sections is redundant.

2. **Resolved entries leave the Active Index immediately.** Once an unknown is resolved, it is removed from the Active Index. Full resolution detail is recorded in the owning file's sidecar under Lessons Learned. This file carries no persistent archive of resolved entries — the Audit Trail's brief resolution notes are the only navigation-layer record maintained here. Active tables show Open, In Progress, and Reopened only.

3. **Compression trigger at 1,200 lines.** If this file exceeds 1,200 lines, a compression pass is mandatory before new entries are added. Compression scope: retire old What sections, verify all resolved actives have been removed from the index, confirm no archive accumulation has restarted.

4. **Audit Trail entries are concise.** Two to three sentences maximum: what changed, what was resolved, what moved to watch lists. The What vX.X section carries the full narrative during the session; the Audit Trail is the permanent compressed record.

5. **Unknown Budget — floor on acknowledged unknowns.** A healthy repository maintains a nonzero active unknown count. If the active index drops below 10 open entries across all clusters, treat this as a signal of premature closure rather than epistemic health — trigger a meta-audit to verify recent resolutions were genuinely grounded and not closed under optimization pressure. The goal is not an empty index; it is an honest one.

6. **Reversion Protocol — when Resolved entries reopen.** A Resolved entry transitions to `Reopened` status when: (a) new empirical input contradicts the evidence that justified closure, (b) the resolution vehicle is shown to be insufficient or incorrect, or (c) a downstream dependency failure exposes the closure as premature. Reversion requires: an Epistemic Ledger entry in the owning file's sidecar documenting the contradictory evidence; an Audit Trail note in this file recording the reversion date and reason; and re-registration in the active index with status `Reopened` and Subtype `Active`. A closed unknown that reopens is not a failure — it is the falsification mechanism working correctly.

Correct the File State field to 2 on next commit to that file, or register HR-003 through HR-008 formally to match the declared count.*

## Expiry Watch

*Expiry Rule is active. Check this table at the opening of each audit cycle.*

**Tier 1 Axiom verification is the mandatory first step** — confirm axiom text in `Admin/Governance_Charter.md` matches prior committed version before proceeding. Any unratified change is a Constitutional violation.

**Epistemic Foundation integrity check is the mandatory second step** — confirm EF-0.0 through EF-0.8b text in `Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md` matches prior committed version. Any unratified modification = Integrity Violation → STATE_HOLD.

FL-001 and several EC entries have been In Progress since v1.1 — approaching two-cycle threshold. Flag for Full Stop Review trigger assessment at next audit opening if still unresolved.

GOV-003 In Progress — Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md is the executing resolution path. GOV-005 remains Critical with no fast resolution path. GOV-007 In Progress — Genesis Phase Protocol executing; full resolution depends on GOV-008. GOV-008 exit condition not yet met.

**RIP-001 Resolved** — Git release tag system (V0.6–V0.97, GPG-signed) fulfills prior-state archival at v0 scale. Discharged via Lessons Learned 2026-06-28. Full resolution detail in Admin/Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md sidecar.

**EN-001 Critical/Blocking** — no structural specification may be promoted without validated safety factors for salvaged materials.

**CF-001 In Progress/Blocking** — parameters defined (τ=50ms WDT). Remains Blocking until first hardware prototype validates at Measured confidence.

**AP Systemic Risk escalation** — AP-001, AP-002, AP-004, AP-005, AP-007 In Progress; AP-012 and AP-016 Critical. Formal escalation downgrade requires human governing party confirmation at next audit cycle.

### Critical Watch

| ID | Note |
|----|------|
| GOV-005 | Constitutional stability — no fast resolution path; requires operational cycles |
| SEC-007a | External root-of-trust, constitutional layer — architectural decision above repository level required; blocks SEC-007b |
| SEC-007b | External root-of-trust, physical implementation layer — blocked pending SEC-007a resolution |
| UNK-009 | External root-of-trust cross-module — spans GOV-003, GOV-005, RIP-001, SEC-007a/SEC-007b |
| EC-008 | Inferred authorization — softest point in permission model; interim default (no material alteration) in place; formal resolution required before operational deployment |
| EC-011 | Human governance adversary model — load-bearing assumption under "capability never outruns permission"; no protection if permission source is compromised |
| EV-003 | Battery thermal containment — no enclosed battery bank until resolved |
| PL-001 | Halogenated polymer contamination — no hot pyrolysis run before triage protocol validated |
| WW-005 | IFM detection — no powered machinery contact with raw urban salvage until screening validated |
| EN-001 | Validated safety factors for salvaged materials — no structural specification promotion until resolved |
| CF-001 | Hardware watchdog — In Progress; Blocking until hardware prototype validates at Measured confidence |
| TH-003 | Atmospheric moisture yield — Blocking for Living Waters deployment |
| FA-001 | Site not confirmed — no hot operations until site physically assessed |
| EC-002 | Operating cost baseline not established — blocks TR-001; depends on EV-001 |
| PR-001 | Precision ceiling not declared — blocks T1/T2 part claims; PR-004 prerequisite |
| EM-001 | Behavioral opacity detection threshold — depends on CF-001 hardware validation |
| EM-004 | Governance substrate integrity under emergent agent access — Critical; mirrors GOV-003, SEC-007a |
| WA-002 | Hazardous fraction identification reliability — safety-critical before mixed-waste operations |
| WA-004 | Negative-value waste fraction disposal — no owning file; mirrors GR-003 gap |
| CM-002 | Acid leach reagent recovery doctrine — no hydrometallurgical processing before closed-loop specified |
| CE-003 | Field polymer identification reliability — Critical; blocks first hot pyrolysis run |
| TF-006 | Non-target insect capture — Ethical_Constraints escalation candidate; halt expansion if threshold cannot be bounded |
| SD-UNK-004 | Host geology fracturing threshold — no excavation without geomechanical assessment; parallels FA-001 |
| LW-UNK-001 | Volatile co-distillation in LW-001 — CRITICAL safety gap; blocks potable output claim |
| LW-UNK-003 | LW-003 lumen implosion — CRITICAL; 4.9 MPa net crush load at 500 m |
| AP-012 | Human authority availability — terminal dependency on human intervention was load-bearing and unstated; autonomous graceful degradation doctrine is resolution path; co-resolves AP-016 |
| AP-016 | Concurrent multi-node quarantine — cascade deadlock scenario confirmed by Class 10 adversarial pass; co-resolves under AP-012 doctrine |
| GH-009 | Emergent heuristic conflict — N² interaction scaling; two independently verified heuristics may fail catastrophically in combination; Interaction Volume doctrine required before knowledge base scales |
| HR-UNK-002 | Hydrologic Resource Cascade material quality — flood sediment contaminant risk; safety-critical before any resource extraction operations |

### Blocking Watch

| ID | Note |
|----|------|
| GOV-008 | Minimum quorum — GOV-007 Genesis Phase exit condition not yet met |
| PL-002 | Reactor pressure control — no reactor fabrication before pressure relief specified |
| WW-004 | Mixed-species dust — interim mitigation (P100 mandatory); formal characterization required |

## Audit Trail

**v1.0–v3.0 (May–June 2026):** Full audit cycle across all primary documents. Seven operational gates, all Challenges/ and Tests/ clusters, and core Admin/ files indexed. Approximately 250 unknowns registered across GI, GR, GF, GU, EL, GOV, AP, RIP, SEC, EC, GMP, RS, PR, FA, SP, LW, TF, SD, EM, WA, BF, PO, WS, CM, CF clusters. Dependency Map and Discovery.md task tables retired. Twelve items resolved.
**v3.1 — 2026-06-11:** Location abstraction pass. TH-003, EN-002, FA-004 retitled to deployment-generic framing.
**v3.2 — 2026-06-11:** Architecture audit integration pass. ME-003, ME-004, TH-005, TH-006, CE-005, EN-006, FD-005 added. CE-003 elevated to Critical Watch. CE-004 In Progress. FA-005 resolved.
**v3.3 — 2026-06-14:** Three new Tests/ file clusters registered. LW (9), TF (10), SD (12) unknowns. TF-006 and SD-UNK-004 added to Critical Watch. DS-001 closed. 31 total new unknowns.
**v3.4 — 2026-06-18:** EC-008, EC-009, EC-010, EC-011, GOV-010, CT-005 registered. GOV-001 un-archived — returned to In Progress. EC-008, EC-011 added to Critical Watch.
**v3.5 — 2026-06-19:** SEC-008–011, RIP-006–007, GMP-006–008 registered. RIP-004 discharged. GMP-005 In Progress.
**v3.6 — 2026-06-19:** ENV cluster registered (9 unknowns). Environmental_Constraints.md created. ENV-007 resolved.
**v3.7 — 2026-06-21:** AP cluster updated per Auditor_Protocols.md v0.11. AP-006, AP-009 resolved. AP-001, AP-002, AP-004, AP-005 moved to In Progress. AP-008, AP-010, AP-011 registered. ENV-008 resolved. GOV-009, GOV-010, EC-010 moved to In Progress. EP-004 In Progress.
**v3.8 — 2026-06-21:** Structural maturation pass. Subtype column added to all active index tables. Unknown Budget and Reversion Protocol added to Size Management Rules. Dependency Clusters section added. Reopened status formally defined. AP-001 updated with retrospective calibration note.
**v3.9 — 2026-06-23:** RC governance pass. RC-007 through RC-009 registered in Future/Deferred with owning file Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md. Operational Blocking and Epistemic Blocking added to Canonical_Terms.md v0.3 as canonical vocabulary. CT-006 and CT-007 registered in CT sidecar.
**v4.0 — 2026-06-24:** Full Adversarial Battery pass on Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md complete — Classes 1–10, Claude + Gemini. Nine new unknowns AP-012 through AP-020 registered. AP-012 and AP-016 elevated to Critical Watch. Human Interaction Point Doctrine added. EF-0.2 autonomous degradation amendment committed. Gate 3 blocked pending AP-012/AP-016 Provisional Spec. AP-020 flagged for Trajectory discharge decision.
**v4.1 — 2026-06-24:** Cognitive Salvage cluster registered (GH-001 through GH-012). GH-009 Critical. GH-012 registered. GH-009 added to Dependency Clusters and Critical Watch. HF-001 registered in Canonical_Terms.md v0.3; CT-008 logged.
**v4.2 — 2026-06-28:** RIP-001 closed (Git release tags fulfill prior-state archival; full detail in Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md sidecar). RIP-006 In Progress. ST-004 registered. CT-008 In Progress, CT-009 Open. CF-004 registered. HR cluster added: HR-UNK-001 and HR-UNK-002 (both Critical). GH-009 and HR-UNK-002 added to Critical Watch.
**v4.3 — 2026-07-01:** Structural compression pass. Resolved & Discharged Archive retired — resolution detail lives in owning file sidecars per Lessons Learned doctrine; archive was a permanent accumulator contradicting the stated navigation-layer purpose. Audit Trail v1.0–v3.0 condensed to arc summary. Dead prose removed. Size Management Rule 2 updated. RE-UNK-001 through RE-UNK-005 registered (Challenges/Return_To_Eden.md, cycle 11); RE-UNK-001 and RE-UNK-005 co-blocking at Tier I gate. NT-010 registered (Admin/Nothingness Theorem, cycle 11). Philosophical/Foundational cluster added.
**v4.4 — 2026-07-02:** Multi-agent Security_Protocols.md audit follow-through. SEC-012 registered (asymmetric crypto overhead on constrained salvaged silicon; cross-ref EL-006). SEC-007 vertically split into SEC-007a (constitutional layer) and SEC-007b (physical implementation layer, blocked pending SEC-007a) — ad hoc pattern, human-governing-authority-adopted, not yet canonized. Dependency Clusters, UNK-009, GMP-004, EM-004 cross-refs updated to match split. Grok/Gemini G3/G6 gate-maturity disagreement on Security_Protocols.md flagged unresolved, pending human ruling.
**v4.5 — 2026-07-02:** External Design Lineage (EDL) registry added to Security_Protocols.md (PAT-001 through PAT-004; anchors SEC-007a, SEC-007b, SEC-005, SEC-011). Cross-refs added to corresponding rows above. Corrected a drafting error conflating a proposed symmetric-fallback-tree unknown with SEC-012 (unrelated; SEC-012 stays scoped to asymmetric-crypto/salvaged-silicon overhead). Declined to adopt a companion proposal (GOV-MAND-009) canonizing EDL as a repository-wide constitutional promotion gate with automated harness enforcement — routed to Governance_Migration_Protocol.md for future human ratification instead of session-level adoption. Known drift at close: Security_Protocols.md's own SEC-007 sidecar entry not yet split to match; Grok/Gemini G3/G6 gate-maturity disagreement unresolved, pending human ruling.
**v4.6 — 2026-07-02:** Two items closed from v4.5. (1) Security_Protocols.md's SEC-007 sidecar reconciled into SEC-007a/SEC-007b (file → v0.7). (2) Grok/Gemini G3/G6 dispute logged as SEC-DS-001 in Security_Protocols.md Active Disputes per Auditor_Protocols.md §Dispute Handling Protocol, and resolved via Forge_Audit_Kit.md v1.5's new Gate Scope vs. Promotion Readiness clarification (sourced from Auditor_Protocols.md §Specification Promotion Rules — gates test execution quality; open-unknown blocking is a separate promotion condition). Gemini's original scoring confirmed structurally correct. Forge_Audit_Kit.md bumped to v1.5; its stale Unknowns.md derivation string (v4.0) corrected. Process correction: an earlier attempt to record item (1) mutated already-committed v4.5 text in place rather than version-bumping — reverted; v4.5 entry above is the original committed text, unedited.
**v4.7 — 2026-07-02:** Discovery.md reconciliation. Confirmed Discovery.md's historical Pending-Corrections-to-PC-cluster migration was correctly principled, not a mistake; refreshed Discovery.md's stale Attention Required table (was pre-dating the SEC-007 split) to current state and added an explicit reciprocal pointer here to Discovery.md's per-file Scope Map Upstream/Downstream context. Discovery.md gained a new Objectives section. Verification_Gates_LF.md's VG-001 logged its first concrete incident (Forge_Audit_Kit.md v1.5 citation gap, caught, no actual divergence, kit → v1.6); VG-001 remains Open.
**v4.8 — 2026-07-03:** AP-001–007 Systemic Risk escalation downgrade confirmed by human governing authority (Auditor_Protocols.md → v0.15); underlying AP-001–005/007 unknowns unchanged, In Progress. A separately-drafted, unrequested "v0.15" patch claiming AP-001/012/016 individually resolved was received and explicitly not incorporated — held for review pending full specification text (AP-012/AP-016 are Gate-3-blocking Critical items). VG-001 discharged via Gate Definition Synchronization Protocol (Verification_Gates_LF.md → v0.4); removed from active index and Critical Watch.

## File Purpose

The Spin Chamber is the primary thermal processing module of the Lazarus Forge.
It receives metallic feedstock from the Material Separation Gate and converts it
into ranked material streams through the combined application of induction heating,
slow rotation, and electromagnetic field stabilization. Its outputs feed structural
fabrication, component upgrades, and — through a planned wire extrusion interface —
welding wire production as a pathway toward self-replication.

The chamber is designed for long operational life, predictable behavior, and
modular repair. It prioritizes survivability and consistency over throughput or
purity. It is not the only path to thermal processing within the Forge, but it
is the most elegant one — combining multiple physical biases into a single
patient system rather than requiring separate stages. If this file disappeared,
thermal processing would require more complex, less integrated alternatives.

## Assumptions

| ID      | Assumption | Basis | Confidence | Expiry Trigger |
|---------|------------|-------|------------|----------------|
| ASM-001 | Grid or equivalent power (5–15kW) is available at bootstrap | v0 site context | Medium | Off-grid or power-constrained deployment confirmed |
| ASM-002 | Feedstock is whatever salvage stock is available; single-stock runs preferred to minimize cross-contamination; aluminum expected as easiest starting material | Metallurgical practice, v0 scope | Medium | Multi-stock processing validated or intentionally adopted |
| ASM-003 | v0 operating environment is terrestrial | No marine or vacuum provisions in v0 spec | Medium | Leviathan or off-world deployment enters scope |
| ASM-004 | Manual operator presence during operation | Control philosophy assumes human response to threshold alerts | Medium | Automated shutdown and monitoring validated |
| ASM-005 | Graphite crucible stock is obtainable through salvage, commercial supply, or inter-forge trade at bootstrap | Purchase-what-cannot-be-produced doctrine; forge ecology context | Low | Local fabrication of crucibles demonstrated |
| ASM-006 | Induction coils can be sourced, purchased, or obtained through inter-forge trade at v0 bootstrap | Purchase-what-cannot-be-produced doctrine; not all forges produce everything | Low | Coil self-fabrication demonstrated |

*Low confidence assumptions reflect resolution paths that vary by forge
instance and deployment context, not critical failure points.
Purchase-what-cannot-be-produced doctrine and inter-forge trade
are valid resolution paths. See README.md and
`Admin/Trajectories.md` for forge ecology context.*

## 1. Purpose

The Spin Chamber is the keystone module of Lazarus Forge. It converts mixed metallic
scrap into **ranked material streams** using overlapping physical biases (heat, rotation,
and electromagnetic fields). The goal is *progressive enrichment* and *capability
replication*, not single-pass purity.

This v0 design prioritizes:

- Long operational life
- Predictable behavior
- Modular repair
- Bootstrap compatibility (built from salvage, improves itself over generations)

---

## 2. Operating Principle

1. **Induction melting** homogenizes incoming scrap
2. **Slow rotation** biases the melt radially by density
3. **Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) damping** stabilizes flow and suppresses turbulence
4. **Time under bias** allows impurities to migrate and segregate
5. **Selective extraction** (tapping / extrusion) routes material by role

The chamber does not aim to produce "pure metal." It produces **useful gradients**.

---

## 3. System Overview

**Stationary outer shell**
- Structural containment
- Thermal insulation
- Houses coils and sensors

**Rotating inner crucible**
- Contains molten metal
- Provides centrifugal bias

**External induction coils**
- Heat source
- Optional MHD field shaping

**Drive module**
- Low RPM rotation
- High tolerance to imbalance

**Extraction interfaces**
- Slag skim
- Radial taps (optional)
- Centerline wire extrusion (future-ready)

---

## 4. Scale & Geometry (v0 Envelope)

- **Internal diameter:** 200–250 mm *(Analogous — derived from small induction furnace commercial offerings)*
- **Internal height:** 200–300 mm *(Analogous)*
- **Melt volume:** 5–10 L *(Analogous)*
- **Batch mass:** ~10–25 kg Al class *(Analogous)*

**Crucible geometry:**
- Rounded conical or shallow paraboloid bottom
- No flat surfaces
- Generous radii to avoid dead zones

**Wall thickness:**
- Graphite: 10–15 mm *(Analogous)*
- Ceramic: 15–25 mm *(Analogous)*

---

## 5. Materials

**Crucible (v0):**
- Graphite (preferred; sacrificial, forgiving)
- Alumina / mullite ceramics (acceptable)

**Outer shell:**
- Refractory liner
- Insulation layer
- Structural steel jacket

**Design note:** Wear is acceptable. Sudden failure is not.

---

## 6. Rotation System

- **Operating RPM:** 50–300 *(Placeholder — bounds derived from first principles, not tested)*
- **Nominal RPM:** 100–150 *(Placeholder)*
- **Never exceed (v0):** 400 *(Simulated — centrifugal pressure and hoop stress
  calculated 2026-05-15; safety factor ~32× at worst-case inputs. Binding constraint
  is dynamic imbalance, not wall integrity. See SC-005 and Lessons Learned 2026-05-15)*

**Drive philosophy:**
- External motor
- Belt or chain drive
- Slip or clutch preferred
- Alignment by geometry, not precision machining
- Component standardization required — bearing sizes, shaft diameters, and fastener
  standards must be drawn from a minimal shared set to support inter-forge
  interchangeability and repair. See SC-005.

---

## 7. Heating & Thermal Strategy

**Heating:**
- External induction coils
- Single zone acceptable for v0
- Power range: 5–15 kW *(Analogous — small induction furnace data)*

**Temperature bands (Al class):**
- Hot idle: 500–550 °C *(Analogous)*
- Processing: 650–720 °C *(Analogous)*

**Thermal doctrine:**
- Maintain near-constant elevated temperature
- Avoid full thermal cycling
- Stop rotation before cooling

This dramatically extends crucible and coil life.

---

## 8. Electromagnetic Fields (v0)

- No electrodes in melt
- No electrochemical assumptions
- Induction fields provide heating and incidental MHD effects
- Optional auxiliary coils for millitesla-scale flow damping *(Placeholder —
  effectiveness at v0 scale and power budget unverified. See SC-003)*

Purpose is **stability**, not forceful separation.

---

## 9. Atmosphere Control

- Passive reducing environment preferred
- Charcoal bed or inert purge if available
- Oxygen ingress minimized, not eliminated

Precision gas chemistry is out of scope for v0.

---

## 10. Extraction & Outputs

**Primary outputs:**
- Slag / oxide layer (skimmed)
- Bulk structural alloy
- Composition-biased inner fraction

**Wire extrusion (planned path):**
- Centerline bottom tap
- Heated, replaceable nozzle
- Diameter controlled by draw speed
- Purpose: welding wire production as a direct pathway toward self-replication
- Nozzle design deferred to v1 scope — see SC-004

Wire is the preferred first product for self-replication.

---

## 11. Instrumentation & Control

**Required sensing:**
- Temperature (2–3 points)
- Motor current
- Induction power draw
- Vibration (coarse accelerometer acceptable)

**Control philosophy:**
- Thresholds and states
- Slow ramps
- Long dwell times

Example rule:
> If vibration increases for 10 minutes, reduce RPM.

---

## 12. Operating Mode

- Batch operation
- Long holds (hours, not minutes)
- Hot idle between runs

Speed is never a success metric.

---

## 13. Expected Outcomes (v0)

**Expect:**
- Predictable segregation trends
- Improved consistency over time
- Learnable wear patterns

**Do not expect:**
- High purity
- High throughput
- Cosmetic perfection

If behavior is stable and repeatable, the chamber is successful.

---

## 14. Failure Philosophy

Acceptable:
- Crucible wear
- Slag buildup
- Gradual vibration drift

Unacceptable:
- Runaway RPM
- Melt breach
- Explosive failure

Design to fail **slowly and visibly**.

---

## 15. Role in Self-Replicating Foundry Logic

The Spin Chamber is a **material contributor** to the self-replicating foundry loop.
Its outputs feed:
- Structural fabrication
- Coil and motor upgrades
- Thermal and refractory improvements
- Welding wire production via planned extrusion interface

Each generation improves the next. Older chambers remain useful. Self-replication
architecture and loop closure logic are governed by `Architecture/Forge_flow.md` and
`Architecture/Geck_forge_seed.md` — not this file.

---

## 16. Summary

The Spin Chamber is not a purifier. It is a patient system that nudges matter
toward order using time, gravity, and fields.

> **Slow spin. Hot idle. Long life.**

This is the tortoise.

## Lessons Learned

| Date | Evidence Type | What Was Tried | What Failed | What Was Learned | Confidence | Revalidation Needed |
|------|---------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|------------|---------------------|
| 2026-05-15 | Modeling | Back-of-envelope centrifugal pressure and hoop stress calculation for 400 RPM never-exceed at worst-case v0 geometry | Nothing failed — calculation ran cleanly | At 400 RPM, worst-case centrifugal pressure on the crucible wall is ~0.037 MPa, producing ~0.463 MPa hoop stress against a 15 MPa graphite allowable. Safety factor ~32×. The never-exceed is not the binding constraint — thermal shock and dynamic imbalance are. See SC-001, SC-005 | Simulated | Yes — cold water analog test before first hot run |

### Reference Equations — Centrifugal Pressure and Hoop Stress

For future RPM limit evaluation, the governing equations are:

**Centrifugal pressure from rotating melt:**
P = ½ × ρ × ω² × r²

**Hoop stress in crucible wall:**
σ_hoop = P × r / t

**Angular velocity conversion:**
ω (rad/s) = RPM × (2π / 60)

**Variables:**
- ρ = melt density (kg/m³) — Al class: 2,700 kg/m³
- ω = angular velocity (rad/s)
- r = internal radius (m)
- t = wall thickness (m)
- P = pressure at wall (Pa)
- σ_hoop = hoop stress (Pa)

**v0 worst-case inputs:**
- r = 0.125m, t = 0.010m, ρ = 2,700 kg/m³, RPM = 400
- Result: Safety factor ~32× against weakest graphite grade (15 MPa)

If pushing beyond 400 RPM in future versions, re-run with updated
geometry, confirmed graphite grade tensile strength, and dynamic
imbalance analysis (SC-005) before revising the never-exceed value.

*No interpretation conflicts are currently active. Several design tensions
exist (MHD damping scope, crucible material selection, RPM operating band)
but all are deferred pending operational data rather than representing
genuine disagreements between positions. These are tracked as unknowns
in the sidecar, not disputes. Revisit after first operational run.*

**Description:** Whether the 50–400 RPM operating envelope is safe and
effective for the specified geometry and melt mass.

**Why It Matters:** An unvalidated never-exceed value provides false
confidence. Exceeding safe RPM with molten contents risks melt breach —
an unacceptable failure mode per the failure philosophy.

**Resolution Path:**
- Static centrifugal pressure and hoop stress calculated 2026-05-15.
  Safety factor ~32× at worst-case inputs. Never-exceed of 400 RPM is
  not the binding constraint on wall integrity. See Lessons Learned
  entry 2026-05-15 for equations and inputs.
- Binding constraints identified as thermal shock and dynamic imbalance
  — dynamic analysis deferred to SC-005 pending drive system specification.
- Cold water analog test remains required before first hot run. Purpose
  is now specifically to validate balance and vibration behavior, not
  wall integrity.
- Payment via Specification — once analog test completes and drive system
  is specified, move validated envelope to Body.

**Description:** Whether meaningful density-based segregation is
achievable at 5–10L melt volume and 100–150 RPM nominal operating
band in a v0 geometry crucible.

**Why It Matters:** Segregation effectiveness is the core claim of
the Spin Chamber. If meaningful gradients do not form at v0 scale
and RPM, the chamber's primary value proposition is undemonstrated.
The Forge can still process material thermally, but the ranked
material stream output becomes bulk melt — a significant capability
reduction.

**Resolution Path:**
- Literature search for small-scale centrifugal casting and rotary
  furnace analog data at similar volumes and RPM bands. If analog
  data exists, upgrade confidence label from Placeholder to Analogous.
- If no analog data found, flag as Placeholder until first operational
  run produces gradient measurement data.
- Cold water analog test (see SC-001) can provide early qualitative
  evidence of radial stratification behavior before first hot run.
- Payment via Specification — once operational gradient data exists
  and is consistent across multiple runs, move validated segregation
  parameters to Body as Measured.
- This is the highest priority validation for the chamber's core claim
  and should be treated as the primary success metric for Gen-0
  operational testing.

**Description:** Whether millitesla-scale auxiliary fields provide
meaningful flow damping at v0 scale and power budget, or negligible
effect.

**Why It Matters:** If MHD damping provides no measurable benefit at
v0 scale, retaining it in the specification adds complexity without
return. Removing it simplifies the v0 build and defers the capability
honestly to a higher-power future version.

**Resolution Path:**
- MHD damping is correctly marked optional in the body. No action
  required before first operational run.
- During Gen-0 testing, run comparative holds with and without
  auxiliary coil activation. Look for measurable difference in
  vibration signature, segregation consistency, or melt stability.
- If no measurable benefit observed at v0 scale: discharge via
  Trajectory — route full MHD specification to `Admin/Trajectories.md`
  for higher-power future versions. Remove optional language from
  v0 body to reduce complexity.
- If measurable benefit observed: Payment via Specification —

**Description:** Nozzle material, geometry, replacement interval,
and draw speed control method for the centerline wire extrusion
path are not yet specified.

**Why It Matters:** Wire extrusion is the planned first product
for welding wire production and a direct pathway toward
self-replication. Without a nozzle specification, the extrusion
interface remains a placeholder and the self-replication pathway
it enables cannot be validated or built toward deliberately.

**Resolution Path:**
- Wire extrusion is correctly marked future-ready in the body
  for v0. No action required before first operational run.
- Nozzle design is a v1 specification task, triggered when:
  1. Spin Chamber Gen-0 operational run demonstrates stable
     melt output
  2. Welding wire specification and qualification requirements
     are defined (currently unowned — see cross-module gap
     noted in Scope Boundary)
  3. Draw speed control method is selected and integrated
     with instrumentation spec
- Discharge via Trajectory — route full nozzle specification
  to `Admin/Trajectories.md` v1 scope.
- Payment via Specification — once nozzle design is validated

**Description:** Drive shaft geometry, bearing selection, mounting
stiffness, and critical speed are not specified. Dynamic imbalance
analysis cannot be completed without these inputs.

**Why It Matters:** Static analysis (SC-001, Lessons Learned
2026-05-15) confirms 32× wall integrity margin at 400 RPM. Dynamic
imbalance from asymmetric melt loading cycles at rotation frequency
and can excite resonance — at 20kg melt mass with 5mm eccentricity,
~175N cyclical force at 400 RPM. Acceptability depends on bearing
load rating and shaft stiffness, neither currently specified. An
undersized or non-standard component could produce progressive
failure that monitoring catches too late.

**Resolution Path:**
- When specifying drive system, select from a minimal set of
  standardized bearing sizes, shaft diameters, and fastener
  standards. Interchangeability across forge instances is a
  design requirement, not a preference. A bearing that can be
  sourced, replaced, or traded between forges is worth more
  than an optimal but bespoke one. Standardization is how the
  forge ecology scales.
- Calculate critical speed once shaft geometry is selected.
  Confirm operating RPM band sits below first critical frequency
  with adequate margin.
- Reference imbalance force equation: F = m × e × ω²
  where m = melt mass, e = eccentricity, ω = angular velocity.
  Run for worst-case eccentricity once crucible mounting is defined.
- Cold water analog test (SC-001) provides empirical imbalance
  data before full specification — treat results as design input,
  not just validation.
- Payment via Specification — once drive system is specified to
  standard components, critical speed calculated, and analog test
  data reviewed, move validated dynamic envelope to Body alongside
  RPM never-exceed.

**Description:** No facility, siting, or area-of-operation document
exists to govern physical separation requirements, clearance zones,
or operator safety protocols during hot and rotating states.

**Why It Matters:** The Spin Chamber operates with molten metal under
rotation. Breach, splash, and projectile hazards are credible failure
modes. The operational safety advisory at the top of this file states
the requirement for physical separation from living organisms and
sensitive components — but no governing document currently defines
what that separation looks like in practice, at what distances, or
under what conditions.

**Resolution Path:**
- `Architecture/Facilities.md` was created 2026-06-06 and now
  owns siting and clearance doctrine for all hot and rotating
  modules. This entry discharges by reference to FA-001 once
  the safety advisory is updated to cross-reference
  `Architecture/Facilities.md` and the Spin Chamber-specific
  siting requirements are documented there.
- Siting requirements vary by deployment context —
  terrestrial, marine (`Tests/Support_Raft.md`), and future
  off-world contexts each carry different constraints.
- UNK-006 resolved — `Unknowns.md` cross-module entry now
  routes to `Architecture/Facilities.md` as the governing
  siting document.
- Discharge via Trajectory for off-world and marine variants.
  Payment via Specification for terrestrial v0 baseline
  once `Architecture/Facilities.md` FA-001 is resolved.

### Resolution Log

- 2026-05-15: SC-001 — Status updated from Open to In Progress.
  Static centrifugal pressure and hoop stress calculated. Safety
  factor ~32× at worst-case v0 inputs. Never-exceed of 400 RPM
  confirmed not the binding constraint on wall integrity. Binding
  constraints identified as thermal shock and dynamic imbalance.
  Dynamic analysis deferred to SC-005. Cold water analog test
  remains required — purpose reframed from wall integrity
  validation to balance and vibration characterization.
- 2026-06-08: Navigation Anchors block added. Title corrected
  from `Spin Chamber (v0)` to `Gate_05_Separation_Thermal`.
  Verification Ref corrected from `Verification_Gates_LF.md`
  to `Admin/Verification_Gates_LF.md` (PC-001). Facilities.md
  upstream reference added to Scope Boundary (PC-002). All
  stale filenames corrected throughout: Material_Separation_Gate_v0.md
  → Gate_04_Separation_Mechanical.md, Lazarus_forge_v0_flow.md
  → Forge_flow.md, geck_forge_seed.md → Geck_forge_seed.md,
  Trajectories_LF.md → Trajectories.md, energy_v0.md →
  Energy.md, Support_Raft_v0.md → Support_Raft.md,
  LF_File_Template.md → File_Template.md. Sidecar Owner
  fields corrected from Spin_Chamber_v0.md to
  Operations/Gate_05_Separation_Thermal.md. SC-006 resolution
  path updated — Architecture/Facilities.md now exists and
  owns siting doctrine; UNK-006 resolved.

## Abandoned Paths

| Date | Path | Why Abandoned | Reconsider? |
|------|------|---------------|-------------|
| 2026-05-15 | Single-pass purity as primary output goal | Purity-first design requires significantly more complex separation chemistry, higher energy input, and precision equipment incompatible with v0 bootstrap constraints. Gradient production with progressive enrichment over generations is more honest to v0 capability and more aligned with forge ecology doctrine | No |
| 2026-05-15 | High throughput as a success metric | Speed optimization conflicts directly with the thermal doctrine of long holds, hot idle, and crucible longevity. A fast chamber is a worn chamber. Throughput is a v2+ consideration after stability and repeatability are demonstrated | No |
| 2026-05-15 | Electrochemical separation via in-melt electrodes | Requires precision gas chemistry, electrode materials, and process control beyond v0 bootstrap scope. Adds failure modes without validated benefit at this scale. Section 8 explicitly excludes electrochemical assumptions | No |
| 2026-05-15 | Precision machining for drive alignment | Alignment by geometry preferred over precision machining — reduces fabrication dependency, supports bootstrap compatibility, and is consistent with standardization doctrine. Precision machining is a capability to grow into, not a v0 requirement | Reconsider at v2 when metrology capability matures |

## Drift Indicators

The following conditions trigger mandatory re-audit of this file.
All canonical drift indicators from `Admin/File_Template.md` apply.
The following are additional local triggers specific to the
Spin Chamber:

### Local Drift Triggers

| Trigger | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| SC-002 remains unreviewed after first operational run | Segregation effectiveness is the core claim — operational data must feed back immediately |
| RPM never-exceed revised without SC-005 resolution | Dynamic analysis is a prerequisite for any RPM limit change |
| Drive system specified with non-standard components without documented justification | Standardization doctrine applies — bespoke components require explicit override |
| Safety Advisory conditions change without SC-006 update | Siting requirements and the advisory must stay synchronized |
| Wire extrusion interface advanced without welding wire specification owner identified | SC-004 and the unowned cross-module gap must resolve together |
| Melt material class expands beyond Al-class without assumptions review | ASM-002 expiry trigger — temperature bands, density values, and crucible material selection all change with material class |
| Hot idle doctrine abandoned in favor of full thermal cycling | Core thermal doctrine — crucible and coil life assumptions depend on it |

### Canonical Drift Triggers

*All mandatory re-audit conditions from `Admin/File_Template.md`
Section 10 apply without exception. Local triggers above are
additive, not substitutes.*

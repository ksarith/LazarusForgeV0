## Scope Boundary

**This file DOES define:**
- Site-specific and regional environmental parameters that materially affect Forge operations
- Regulatory, climatic, ecological, and jurisdictional constraint categories
- Bootstrap environmental risk assessment and mitigation priorities
- Integration interlocks between environmental conditions and core operational metrics
- Graceful degradation triggers tied to environmental conditions
- Junction point for EC-010 (jurisdiction conflict), GOV-010 (regulatory compliance friction), and related cross-module convergences

**This file DOES NOT define:**
- Detailed engineering specifications for facilities or equipment (→ `Architecture/Facilities.md`, `Operations/`)
- Physical site safety margins, PPE, heat stress, emergency response (→ `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md`)
- Constitutional governance doctrine (→ `Admin/Governance_Charter.md`)
- Specific material processing procedures (→ `Operations/`)
- Long-term climate modeling or environmental activism
- Jurisdiction conflict resolution hierarchy — pending ENV-003
- Human authority conflict resolution in contested jurisdictions — pending `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` EC-009

---

## File Purpose

This file establishes the environmental boundary conditions within which the Lazarus Forge must operate. It exists to prevent optimistic assumptions about "standard conditions" from undermining bootstrap viability, regulatory survival, or ecological accountability. Without it, deployments risk catastrophic mismatch between doctrine and physical reality — leading to mission failure, legal friction, or unintended environmental harm.

This file is also the planned resolution junction for EC-010 (`Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` — jurisdiction conflict hierarchy) and GOV-010 (`Admin/Governance_Charter.md` — regulatory compliance friction for physical deployment). Both unknowns explicitly converge here at v1 transition. This file is created now so those unknowns have a resolution target and so site-specific context can accumulate before it is urgently needed.

**Honest v0 acknowledgment:** At current maturity, environmental constraints are documented as doctrine categories, not validated operational parameters. Site-specific values must be substituted from the Reference Deployment Context (RDC) when deployment begins. No claim in this file should be treated as operationally hardened until local site data replaces the placeholder anchors.

## Body

### Core Doctrine

Environmental constraints are treated as **non-negotiable boundary conditions**, not obstacles to be optimized away. The Forge adapts to the environment; it does not demand the environment adapt to the Forge. All major decisions — site selection, gate sequencing, energy strategy, material triage — must route through these constraints before execution.

**Primary Interlock:** Every environmental factor must ultimately be evaluated against Value Recovered per kWh and graceful degradation capacity. A solution that functions under controlled conditions but fails under real local conditions (dust, humidity, temperature extremes, regulatory hostility, community friction) is rejected. The environment is the test, not the lab.

**No externalized entropy:** The Forge's salvage-first philosophy extends to environmental impact. Do not solve internal resource problems by externalizing waste, contamination, or entropy into the surrounding environment. This is both a practical doctrine (regulatory risk, community trust) and an ethical requirement under Axiom P-1 (Preservation of Life) and Axiom P-3 (Collaboration and Mutual Benefit).

---

### Constraint Category 1 — Climatic and Physical

These are the environmental realities of the physical site. They change slowly but determine the operational envelope for every gate.

**Key parameters (Placeholder — substitute from site assessment):**
- Temperature range (operating and storage extremes)
- Humidity range (affects electronics, corrosion, dust behavior)
- Precipitation pattern (flooding risk, drainage requirements, water availability)
- Wind loading (structural requirements, dust transport)
- Seismic risk classification
- Dust and particulate environment (affects Air Scrubber demand, electronics handling)
- Biological activity (biofouling rate for marine deployments, pest pressure for land sites)
- UV exposure and weathering rate

**Operational implications:**
- High humidity → elevated corrosion rate in salvaged materials; elevated BFR release risk in electronics processing
- Temperature extremes → battery thermal management constraints (cross-ref `Operations/Energy.md` → EV-003), Peltier device operating range (cross-ref `Architecture/Thermal_Systems.md` → TH-004)
- High dust → Air Scrubber demand increase, sensor fouling (cross-ref `Operations/Gate_04_Separation_Mechanical.md` → MG-008, `Architecture/Friction_Dynamics.md` → FD-002)
- Seismic risk → structural safety factors for salvaged frames (cross-ref `Architecture/Engineering.md` → EN-001, EN-002)

**Primary reference:** `Architecture/Facilities.md` Site Initialization Checklist is the mandatory local substitution document for all Placeholder values above.

---

### Constraint Category 2 — Regulatory and Jurisdictional

Legal and regulatory constraints determine what the Forge may do at a given site. They are treated as hard external inputs, not optimization variables.

**Key domains:**
- Permitting requirements for waste handling, thermal processing, and metal recovery
- Emissions limits (particulate, VOC, thermal)
- Hazardous material handling regulations (asbestos, heavy metals, BFR-containing materials — cross-ref `Challenges/Waste.md` → WA-002, `Architecture/Chemistry.md` → CE-003)
- Environmental protection statutes (water discharge, soil contamination)
- Zoning and land use restrictions
- Labor and occupational safety regulations (cross-ref `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md`)
- Maritime law and salvage rights (relevant for Leviathan-class deployments)
- Cultural heritage protections (cross-ref `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` §Cultural and Sacred Site Recognition)

**Bootstrap operating doctrine — ratified 2026-07-17 (human governing authority):**

*Where regulatory frameworks are ambiguous or incomplete, the Forge does not independently decide to operate through the ambiguity. It applies `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md`'s Compliance-Maximizing Default: pursue the most fully-compliant path available that still accomplishes the legitimate salvage/repair goal, and where genuine ambiguity remains after reasonable analysis, escalate to human governing authority per the Human Escalation Protocol rather than proceeding on the system's own judgment. The four conditions previously listed here (human safety not compromised; documentation maintained; no irreversible environmental harm; cessation on clear prohibition) remain relevant as a description of what "operating close to the line" must still satisfy once a human has authorized proceeding — they are not, on their own, a sufficient basis for the system to proceed without that authorization.*

This does not change the escalation doctrine already stated below for unresolvable jurisdictional conflicts, which already routes to `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` §Legal Context Awareness.

**Bridge authority for unavailable escalation (ratified 2026-07-17 alongside the above):** *Where escalation to human governing authority is not available within a timeframe the situation requires — operator unreachable, conditions changing faster than the escalation channel can respond — the system may proceed under the four conditions this file previously specified as sufficient (human safety not compromised; documentation maintained; no irreversible environmental harm; cessation on clear prohibition), treated here as a bounded bridge authority rather than a standing default. This bridge closes automatically the moment escalation becomes available, requires immediate logging of the specific unavailability condition that triggered it, and mandates expedited post-hoc human review at the next available opportunity — not routine review, but priority review, since bridge-authority action bypassed the normal deference sequence. This does not authorize action that Tier 1 Axioms or the Anti-Weaponization Doctrine would prohibit under any circumstance.*

**Jurisdiction conflicts:** When laws are mutually incompatible (maritime vs. national, environmental vs. salvage rights, multiple sovereign claims), escalate to human review per `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` §Legal Context Awareness. Until ENV-003 (jurisdiction conflict hierarchy) is resolved, "escalate to human review" is the operative instruction. For Leviathan-class deployments, assume multi-jurisdiction environments as the default condition, not the exception.

**Regulatory compliance unknown tracking:** FA-003 (zoning and permitting), SP-005 (regulatory compliance), EC-010 (jurisdiction conflict), GOV-010 (compliance friction) all feed this category. See sidecar.

---

### Constraint Category 3 — Ecological and Resource

The Forge's material recovery mission intersects with local ecological systems. These constraints govern that intersection.

**Resource availability:**
- Local water availability and quality (cross-ref `Challenges/Water.md`, `Tests/Living_Waters.md`)
- Salvage stream density and composition (urban ore concentration, device type mix)
- Critical mineral access via salvage vs. extraction trade-offs (cross-ref `Challenges/Critical_Minerals.md`)
- Renewable energy availability (solar, wind, tidal, thermal gradient — cross-ref `Operations/Energy.md`)

**Ecological impact:**
- Biodiversity sensitivity of deployment site (protected species, habitat corridors)
- Water discharge quality requirements (cross-ref `Challenges/Water.md` WS-002, WS-004)
- Soil contamination risk from operations (cross-ref `Challenges/Waste.md` WA-004)
- Marine ecosystem impact for aquatic deployments (cross-ref `Challenges/Biofouling.md` BF-004, `Tests/Trophic_Forge.md` TF-006)
- Carbon and thermal budget of operations vs. value recovered

**Doctrine:** Net-positive material recovery preferred. Externalizing entropy — dumping processing waste into surrounding ecology to simplify internal operations — is prohibited under the no-externalized-entropy principle above and under Axiom P-1.

---

### Constraint Category 4 — Human and Social

Physical and ecological constraints are well-defined. Human and social constraints are harder to measure but equally capable of ending operations.

**Key dimensions:**
- Community acceptance of salvage operations (noise, truck traffic, visual impact, perceived contamination risk)
- Labor availability and skill base in the deployment region
- Security environment (theft risk for salvaged materials and equipment, operator safety)
- Competing land and resource use claims
- Informal sector relationships (cross-ref `Challenges/Waste.md` WA-003 — informal waste recovery worker integration)
- Community adoption capacity for outputs (cross-ref `Challenges/Water.md` WS-004, `Challenges/Planned_Obsolescence.md` PO-004)

**v0 guidance:** Community friction is most often generated by opacity, not by operations themselves. Early, honest communication about what the Forge does and does not do reduces friction more reliably than technical mitigation. This is both pragmatically sound and consistent with Axiom P-3 (Collaboration and Mutual Benefit).

---

### Adversarial Analysis (Gate 3 — Deferred Classes)

Per `Admin/Forge_Audit_Kit.md`'s Verification Maturity Model, an Exploration-stage document may defer Adversarial Battery classes provided the deferral is explicit and reasoned, rather than simply absent. This file directly touches high-coupling and autonomous failure modes (climate extremes shifting operating envelopes, multi-jurisdictional legal exposure), so an unstated omission is not acceptable at this status level.

**Deferred classes, with rationale:**

| Class | Deferral Rationale |
|---|---|
| Silent Failure (local sensor/telemetry drift, e.g. dust loading on environmental sensors) | No physical site or sensor hardware exists yet to test against; deferred to first site assessment (ENV-001, ENV-009) |
| Coupling (regulatory action intersecting with social/community friction, e.g. a permitting dispute escalating community opposition) | Requires a real jurisdiction and community context to model concretely; deferred to first candidate site regulatory assessment (ENV-002) |
| Irreversibility (ecological contamination pathways going undetected until severe) | No ecological monitoring protocol yet exists to adversarially test (ENV-004 open); deferred to that unknown's resolution |

Full adversarial testing against these classes is targeted for Gate 2/v1 transition, once a physical site exists to test against. Until then, this file's Highest Risk rating (High) should be read as reflecting exactly this — real risk categories acknowledged and deferred, not resolved.

---

### Graceful Degradation Rules

When environmental constraints tighten, the Forge degrades gracefully rather than failing hard or bypassing safety.

| Condition | Degradation Response |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Regulatory uncertainty increases | Reduce operational scope to lowest-risk activities; maintain documentation; pause contested operations |
| Climate conditions exceed design envelope | Reduce throughput; increase human oversight; defer thermal operations in high fire-risk conditions |
| Community opposition escalates | Pause operations; escalate to human governing party; do not attempt to operate through active community opposition |
| Ecological impact detected | Halt the contributing operation; assess and document; do not resume until impact pathway is understood |
| Jurisdictional conflict unresolvable by human review | Default to non-action per `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` §Core Mandate |
| Unidentified or ambiguous environmental anomaly detected (e.g. unlogged chemical markers, shifting baseline physical constants) | Revert affected processing gates to verified passive states; isolate the sensor cluster; log an immediate site-specific unknown; do not attempt automated override |

**Hard rule:** Never sacrifice Tier 1 Axioms to meet environmental targets, throughput goals, or regulatory pressure. If a regulatory authority demands an action that would violate Axiom P-1 or the Anti-Weaponization Doctrine, compliance is refused and the situation is escalated to the human governing party.

| `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md` | Operator heat stress, hearing, and emergency response all require site-specific calibration |
| `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` | Jurisdiction conflicts and human authority questions route here; EC-010 and EC-009 cross-reference |
| `Admin/Governance_Charter.md` | GOV-010 regulatory compliance friction convergence point |
| `Challenges/Waste.md` | Hazardous fraction handling subject to local regulatory constraints |
| `Challenges/Water.md` | Water availability and discharge quality are site-dependent |

## Upstream / Downstream

**Upstream (constrains this file):**
- `Admin/Governance_Charter.md` — Tier 1 Axioms P-1, P-3 are the ethical floor for all environmental decisions
- `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` — Anti-Weaponization, Life Preservation, and jurisdiction escalation doctrine; Compliance-Maximizing Default governs this file's Bootstrap operating doctrine (see Constraint Category 2 reconciliation notice)
- `Architecture/Facilities.md` — Site Initialization Checklist provides the baseline parameter substitution source
- `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md` — operator safety constraints must remain consistent with environmental doctrine

**Downstream (depends on this file):**
- `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` EC-010 — jurisdiction conflict hierarchy resolution path leads here
- `Admin/Governance_Charter.md` GOV-010 — regulatory compliance friction resolution path leads here
- `Architecture/Facilities.md` FA-003 — zoning and permitting assessment references environmental constraint categories
- `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md` SP-005 — regulatory compliance assessment references this file
- `Challenges/Waste.md` WA-003, WA-004 — informal sector integration and disposal doctrine have environmental dimensions
- `Challenges/Water.md` WS-002, WS-004 — water quality and community adoption reference this file
- `Challenges/Biofouling.md` BF-003 — regional fouling rate calibration references local ecological parameters
- `Tests/Leviathan_testing.md` — multi-jurisdiction maritime context is the primary deployment stress environment
- `Tests/Trophic_Forge.md` TF-006 — ecological impact assessment references this file

|------|------|---------------|-------------|
| 2026-06-19 | Deferring this file to v1 transition | EC-010 and GOV-010 have no resolution target without this file; downstream audit friction accumulates with each cycle it is absent; better to create a minimal compliant version now than to defer and accumulate drift | No |
| 2026-06-19 | Merging environmental constraints into Facilities.md | Facilities.md governs physical workspace prerequisites and equipment siting; environmental constraints are a broader category that includes regulatory, ecological, and social dimensions that Facilities.md does not own | No |

## Drift Indicators

Mandatory re-audit conditions for this document:

- Environmental constraints reframed as "to be engineered away" rather than non-negotiable boundary conditions
- Reference Deployment Context used as final answer rather than substitution baseline
- Throughput or capability targets cited as justification for bypassing regulatory compliance
- No-externalized-entropy principle qualified or removed
- Graceful degradation rules weakened to allow operations through active community opposition or detected ecological impact
- Tier 1 Axiom compliance cited as optional when in conflict with environmental or regulatory pressure
- EC-010 and GOV-010 closed without updating this file as their resolution record
- Site-specific values promoted to Specification without local data replacing Placeholder anchors
- Ethical Anchor field absent, altered, or does not match canonical string
- Verification Ref field changed from `Admin/Verification_Gates_LF.md`
- Upstream/Downstream table loses any of the eight downstream dependents listed without a corresponding unknown or correction entry
- Bootstrap operating doctrine's proposed reconciliation (Constraint Category 2) reverted to self-directed gray-zone operation without human governing authority ratification of the reconciled text, or ratified in a form that reintroduces proceeding-without-escalation under ambiguity
- Bridge authority (Constraint Category 2) invoked as a routine default rather than a logged, bounded exception — e.g. escalation attempted only nominally, expedited post-hoc review skipped or delayed, or the four bridge conditions applied without the triggering unavailability condition being documented

**Compound Drift Rule:** If multiple indicators activate simultaneously, halt autonomous audit progression and escalate for human review.

**Description:** All climatic and physical parameters in Constraint Category 1 are Placeholder values. No site-specific measurements exist for temperature range, humidity, dust load, seismic classification, or biological activity at any candidate deployment site.

**Why It Matters:** Every gate calibration that depends on environmental conditions — thermal process scheduling, Air Scrubber sizing, battery thermal management, structural safety factors — remains site-generic until this is resolved. Site-generic values are better than nothing; they are not sufficient for maturity advancement of dependent systems.

**Resolution Path:** Conduct site assessment per `Architecture/Facilities.md` Site Initialization Checklist at first candidate deployment site. Record measured values here, replacing Placeholder anchors. Update dependent files as each value is confirmed.

**Description:** No regulatory compliance assessment has been conducted for any candidate bootstrap site. Permitting requirements, emissions limits, waste handling regulations, and zoning constraints are all unknown for the first deployment context.

**Why It Matters:** Regulatory non-compliance can halt operations with no recovery path. The bootstrap operating doctrine (gray zones with documentation) is a temporary posture, not a sustainable one — and is itself under revision per ENV-DS-001 above. Regulatory mapping must occur before sustained operations begin.

**Resolution Path:** Conduct regulatory landscape assessment for first candidate site. Map applicable regulations against Constraint Category 2 above. Log specific unknowns or blockers as sub-entries. Cross-reference FA-003 (zoning and permitting) and SP-005 (regulatory compliance) — those may resolve concurrently.

**Description:** When laws are mutually incompatible across jurisdictions (maritime vs. national law, environmental law vs. salvage rights, multiple sovereign claims in international waters), the Forge currently escalates to human review. No resolution hierarchy exists beyond that escalation.

**Why It Matters:** Leviathan-class deployments will encounter multi-jurisdiction environments as a default condition. "Escalate to human review" is a valid interim instruction but is not sufficient when human review is unavailable or when conflicts are structural and persistent. Cross-references EC-010 (`Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md`) and GOV-010 (`Admin/Governance_Charter.md`) — both converge here.

**Resolution Path:** Define minimum jurisdiction conflict hierarchy at v1 transition. Minimum doctrine: when jurisdictions conflict and human review is unavailable, default to the more restrictive interpretation of each constraint (cross-ref `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` §Legal Context Awareness). Full hierarchy definition deferred until first Leviathan-class or maritime deployment is planned.

**Description:** The graceful degradation rules specify "halt the contributing operation" when ecological impact is detected, but no assessment protocol exists for detecting impact in the first place. Detection methods, monitoring cadence, threshold criteria, and responsible assessment agent are all undefined.

**Why It Matters:** "Halt when impact detected" is only as strong as the detection mechanism. Without a monitoring protocol, impact may go undetected until it is severe. Cross-references `Tests/Trophic_Forge.md` → TF-006 (non-target insect capture), `Challenges/Biofouling.md` → BF-004 (shed panel reef toxin leach), `Challenges/Waste.md` → WA-004 (negative-value waste disposal).

**Resolution Path:** Define minimum ecological monitoring protocol at Draft or above. Minimum viable version: designated observation check at each audit opening for any active deployment; threshold criteria for three impact dimensions (water discharge quality, soil condition, local species behavior). Cross-reference `Tests/Trophic_Forge.md` and `Challenges/Biofouling.md` for domain-specific impact indicators.

**Description:** Constraint Category 4 notes that community friction is most often generated by opacity, and that early honest communication reduces friction. No formal protocol exists for when to engage, what to communicate, or how to manage escalating community concerns.

**Why It Matters:** Community opposition can halt operations as effectively as regulatory prohibition, and with less predictable timeline. A protocol that engages proactively is cheaper than reactive crisis management. Cross-references `Challenges/Waste.md` → WA-003 (informal sector integration), `Challenges/Planned_Obsolescence.md` → PO-004 (community re-baselining skill transfer), `Challenges/Water.md` → WS-004 (community adoption).

**Resolution Path:** Define minimum community engagement protocol at Draft or above. Minimum doctrine: pre-operation disclosure to directly affected community before any sustained salvage operations begin; designated point of contact for community questions; documented response log for concerns raised.

### ENV-006 — No-externalized-entropy doctrine not operationalized

**Description:** The no-externalized-entropy principle is declared as doctrine but has no operational definition — no metric, no detection mechanism, and no threshold for what constitutes "externalizing entropy" in practice versus acceptable waste generation.

**Why It Matters:** Without operationalization, the principle is aspirational rather than enforceable. "Do not externalize entropy" must eventually become a checkable condition — probably tied to waste stream accounting per gate cycle, similar to how Value Recovered per kWh ties throughput to energy.

**Resolution Path:** Define minimum operationalization at Draft or above. Candidate metric: waste-out-to-material-in ratio per operating cycle, with a threshold above which operations trigger review. Cross-reference `Challenges/Waste.md` WA-004 (negative-value disposal) and `Operations/Gate_03_Reduction.md` GR-003 (biological and chemical waste disposal doctrine).

**Description (historical):** This file was not referenced in `Admin/AUDIT_HARNESS.py` file registry or EXTRA_FILES comment block. Environmental constraint context was not loadable in standard audit sessions.

**Resolution:** `Admin/AUDIT_HARNESS.py` advanced from v7 through v13 across the repository's governance push (late June–early July 2026), with dynamic Routing.md bootstrap as the authoritative registry source — this file is picked up automatically as part of that registry rather than needing a separate static entry. Confirmed live: Gemini's 2026-07-06 audit of this file verified the harness successfully parses this file via Routing.md (62 canonical paths parsed). This sidecar entry had not been revisited since the file's creation date and was corrected 2026-07-06, in step with the same correction already reflected in `Unknowns.md`'s active index, which had not listed ENV-007 as Open.

**Description (historical):** This file did not appear in `Routing.md`, `Discovery.md`, or `Unknowns.md`. Until registered, it was invisible to the audit harness and to agents loading standard navigation context.

**Resolution:** `Discovery.md` records this as Resolved 2026-06-21 (registered in Routing.md and Discovery.md). `Unknowns.md`'s active index confirms — it carries ENV-001 through ENV-006 and ENV-009, with no ENV-007 or ENV-008 entry, meaning both have already dropped from the active index per that file's own Size Management Rule 2 (resolved entries leave the active index immediately). Gemini's 2026-07-06 audit independently confirmed the file is now live-parsed via Routing.md (62 canonical paths). **This file's own sidecar had simply never been updated to reflect any of this** — both ENV-007 and ENV-008 sat as Open with Last Reviewed still showing the file's creation date, 17 days after Discovery.md's own resolution note and across three intervening audit passes that didn't check this sidecar against the navigation files it describes. Downgraded to Partially Addressed rather than fully closed only because full registration status against `Admin/AUDIT_HARNESS.py`'s FILE_REGISTRY (as opposed to its Routing.md-driven dynamic bootstrap) has not been independently re-verified this pass — see ENV-007's resolution note for why this likely doesn't matter, but confirming that distinction wasn't in scope today.

**Description:** This file defines the constraint framework but no deployment site has been evaluated against it. All four constraint categories carry Placeholder values. The file is a doctrine target, not an operational record.

**Why It Matters:** The gap between doctrine and operational reality is the highest-risk condition in the Forge's governance architecture. A file that exists but has never been applied to a real site is not yet validated as useful or complete.

**Resolution Path:** At first candidate site assessment, apply all four constraint categories as a structured checklist. Record findings as site-specific entries. Update Placeholder values with Measured or Estimated data. Log findings that reveal gaps in the constraint framework as new ENV- unknowns. This unknown closes when the first site assessment is complete and recorded here.

**Description:** This file designates `Architecture/Facilities.md`'s Site Initialization Checklist as the mandatory local substitution document for all Constraint Category 1 Placeholder values. Direct comparison against Facilities.md's Section VII checklist (2026-07-07) confirms a **partial gap**, not a full non-operational shell: temperature (summer + winter), humidity, precipitation/flood risk, and dust/particulate baseline all have corresponding mandatory collection fields. However, three of this file's eight Category 1 parameters have **no corresponding field at all** — seismic risk classification, biological activity (biofouling rate, pest pressure), and UV exposure/weathering rate. Wind is only partially covered: the checklist collects prevailing wind *direction* (for exhaust placement) but not wind *loading* (the structural design value this file actually specifies).

**Why It Matters:** A resolution path that points to another file's checklist is only as good as that checklist actually collecting the data being pointed to. For the three fully-missing parameters and the wind-loading gap, this file's substitution mechanism is a non-operational shell — those Placeholder values have no path to ever being replaced until Facilities.md's checklist is extended.

**Resolution Path:** Log a new unknown in `Architecture/Facilities.md`'s own sidecar requesting four additional Section VII rows: seismic risk classification, biological activity baseline, UV exposure/weathering rate, and wind loading (structural, distinct from the existing wind direction row). Until added, treat this file's Placeholder values for those four parameters as unresolvable via the stated substitution mechanism.

### Resolution Log

- 2026-07-17: **v0.4 — ENV-DS-001 ratified (human governing authority).** Both
  pieces of the pending package — the core Compliance-Maximizing Default
  reconciliation (2026-07-06) and the bounded bridge-authority amendment
  (2026-07-07) — adopted together as Constraint Category 2's operative
  Bootstrap operating doctrine, replacing the superseded text. Active
  Disputes 1 → 0.

- 2026-07-07: **v0.3 (proposed) — Bridge-authority amendment to ENV-DS-001's reconciled text**, human-directed. Addresses an operational-continuity gap in the 2026-07-06 reconciliation: escalate-before-proceeding has no fallback when a human is genuinely unreachable within the timeframe a fast-moving situation requires, risking indefinite operational stall. Amendment adds a bounded bridge authority — the original four self-assessed conditions, reactivated only when escalation is unavailable, auto-closing on escalation becoming available, with mandatory logging and expedited post-hoc review. Not a return to unrestricted gray-zone operation; still subordinate to Tier 1 Axioms and Anti-Weaponization Doctrine. Logged as an addition to the same pending-ratification item, not a separate dispute. Corresponding Drift Indicator added for misuse-as-default risk. ENV-010 confirmed against Facilities.md source text — partial gap (three parameters fully missing, one partial), not full non-operational shell as originally flagged as a possibility.

- 2026-07-06: **v0.2 — Doctrine conflict flagged (ENV-DS-001); ENV-007/ENV-008 sidecar drift corrected; ENV-010 logged; Adversarial Analysis section added (G3); bare-ID cross-references canonized (G5).**
  (1) **Bootstrap operating doctrine flagged as conflicting** with `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md`'s Compliance-Maximizing Default (added 2026-07-05) — this file's self-directed gray-zone posture predates that doctrine by 16 days and was never reconciled against it. Proposed reconciled text drafted in Constraint Category 2; logged as ENV-DS-001 in Active Disputes; held pending human governing authority ratification rather than self-approved.
  (2) **ENV-007 and ENV-008 sidecar entries corrected** to reflect what `Discovery.md` (ENV-008 Resolved 2026-06-21) and `Unknowns.md`'s active index (neither entry present) already showed — both had sat unrevisited since file creation across three intervening audit passes. ENV-007 marked Resolved; ENV-008 marked Partially Addressed pending a narrow remaining verification. File State Open Unknowns corrected from 9 to reflect actual active count (ENV-001–006, ENV-009, ENV-010 = 8; ENV-003 remains Minor/non-blocking).
  (3) **ENV-010 logged** (Facilities.md checklist reciprocity unverified), per Gemini's 2026-07-06 audit finding.
  (4) **Adversarial Analysis section added**, declaring three deferred classes (Silent Failure, Coupling, Irreversibility) with rationale, per Gemini's G3 finding — the file's High risk rating had no corresponding adversarial deferral record.
  (5) **All bare cross-reference IDs in body text and two sidecar entries canonized** to folder-prefixed form (e.g. `EV-003` → `` `Operations/Energy.md` → EV-003 ``), per Gemini's G5 finding.
  (6) **Graceful Degradation table gained a new row** for unidentified/ambiguous environmental anomalies, per Gemini's finding that only recognized-input conditions had a defined response.
- 2026-06-19: File created (v0.1). Drafted by Grok (Systems Integrator), revised to File_Template.md compliance by Claude (Synthesizer). Four constraint categories established: Climatic/Physical, Regulatory/Jurisdictional, Ecological/Resource, Human/Social. Core doctrine, graceful degradation rules, integration map, and upstream/downstream table added. ENV-001 through ENV-009 logged. EC-010 and GOV-010 convergence point declared. ENV-008 (registration) is the first priority action before any downstream audit references this file.

## Relationship to Existing Documents

- `Admin/Governance_Charter.md` — Tier 1 Axioms P-1 (Preservation of Life) and P-3 (Collaboration and Mutual Benefit) are the ethical floor for all environmental decisions; GOV-010 (regulatory compliance friction) resolution path leads here
- `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` — EC-010 (jurisdiction conflict hierarchy) and EC-009 (human authority conflict) resolution paths lead here; Life Preservation and Anti-Weaponization doctrines apply when environmental pressure conflicts with Tier 1 constraints; Compliance-Maximizing Default governs this file's Bootstrap operating doctrine (see ENV-DS-001)
- `Architecture/Facilities.md` — Site Initialization Checklist is the primary local substitution document for all Placeholder values in Constraint Category 1; FA-003 (zoning and permitting) cross-references Constraint Category 2; reciprocity with this file's parameter list confirmed partially incomplete (ENV-010)
- `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md` — operator safety constraints must be calibrated against local environmental conditions; SP-005 (regulatory compliance) cross-references this file
- `Operations/Energy.md` — energy strategy is directly shaped by local renewable availability and thermal recovery efficiency
- `Operations/Gate_05_Separation_Thermal.md` — thermal operations subject to fire-risk season and emissions constraints
- `Challenges/Waste.md` — hazardous fraction handling (WA-002, WA-004) subject to local regulatory constraints; informal sector integration (WA-003) has community dimension
- `Challenges/Water.md` — water availability and discharge quality are site-specific; WS-002 and WS-004 reference environmental and community conditions
- `Challenges/Biofouling.md` — BF-003 (regional fouling rate) and BF-004 (shed panel ecological impact) are site-specific
- `Challenges/Critical_Minerals.md` — local mineral access via salvage vs. extraction trade-offs reference this file
- `Tests/Leviathan_testing.md` — multi-jurisdiction maritime environment is the primary stress-test context for all four constraint categories
- `Tests/Trophic_Forge.md` — TF-006 (non-target insect capture) and TF-010 (seasonal variability) reference local ecological conditions
- `Unknowns.md` — ENV-001 through ENV-010 registered; ENV-007/ENV-008 status corrected 2026-07-06
- `Discovery.md` — this file's registration confirmed Resolved 2026-06-21 (ENV-008)
- `Routing.md` — this file's registration confirmed live via dynamic bootstrap (ENV-007)
- `Admin/AUDIT_HARNESS.py` — this file is picked up via dynamic Routing.md bootstrap (v7–v13); static FILE_REGISTRY entry not independently re-verified this pass

## Status

- 2026-07-07: **v0.3 (proposed) — Bridge-authority amendment to ENV-DS-001's reconciled text**, human-directed. See Resolution Log for detail. ENV-010 confirmed as a partial gap against Facilities.md source text.

Version 0.2 — Draft, correction and reconciliation pass (2026-07-06).

**Status update, 2026-07-17:** ENV-DS-001 (Bootstrap operating doctrine reconciliation, including the bridge-authority amendment) ratified by human governing authority — see Resolution Log. No longer the outstanding priority item; Open Unknowns above remain the next-priority items, none currently rated above the general High file risk level.

**What must remain constant:**

**The Forge adapts to the environment. The environment does not adapt to the Forge.**

**No externalized entropy. No compliance theater.**

## Scope Boundary

**This file DOES define:**
- Cryptographic mechanisms for multi-signature Human Override Verification
- Automated code-signing protocols for file integrity verification (RIP Phase 3)
- Node identity verification and key rotation cycles within the cluster environment
- Minimum token complexity, air-gapping requirements, and cryptographic fallback
  behaviors during network division
- Trust boundary declaration: the relationship between cryptographic enforcement
  and governance legitimacy
- Incident logging requirements for authentication events including replay
  protection requirements
- Degraded-operation security doctrine notes
- Compromise detection doctrine (pending — SEC-009)

**This file DOES NOT define:**
- Component-level infiltration prevention for salvaged hardware — governed by
  `Operations/Electronics.md`; this file references that doctrine and sits above
  it in the administrative authority layer
- Specific operating system firewall commands or network router firmware rules
- Local facility access control (locks, badges, physical perimeter barriers)
- Constitutional governance doctrine — governed by `Admin/Governance_Charter.md`
- Auditor operational behavior — governed by `Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md`
- Minimum agent quorum definition for bootstrap compliance — governed by
  GOV-008 in `Admin/Governance_Charter.md`; quorum threshold is a prerequisite
  input to the multi-signature requirements defined here
- Trusted initialization environment definition — see SEC-005 and
  `Admin/Canonical_Terms.md` CT-004
- Human-factors attack surface (social engineering, operator coercion) — pending
  cross-reference to `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md` and `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` EC-011
- Long-duration cryptographic continuity (algorithm migration, entropy
  exhaustion across decades) — pending SEC-011

## File Purpose

This document establishes the technical security implementation rules for
validating administrative authority, ensuring the integrity of the active
knowledge graph, and managing multi-node validation in untrusted, degraded,
or adversarial deployment environments. It bridges the gap between the
constitutional governance declarations in `Admin/Governance_Charter.md` and
the operational integrity procedures in `Admin/Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md`
by defining the cryptographic enforcement layer that makes integrity protections
mechanically verifiable rather than procedurally dependent.

This file is the Phase 3 resolution target for `Admin/Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md`
(RIP-005) and the authentication mechanism resolution target for
`Admin/Governance_Charter.md` (GOV-006). It does not supersede either document —
it implements the enforcement capability they declare as necessary.

**Honest v0 acknowledgment:** At current maturity, cryptographic enforcement
is defined here as a specification target, not an operational reality. Phase 3
automation does not yet exist. This file defines what must be built so that
implementation has a governed target to build against.

## Trust Boundary Declaration

**This principle governs all sections of this document and must be read first.**

Cryptographic verification confirms identity and integrity. It does not confer
governance legitimacy.

A valid signature proves that a file was signed by a known key, and that the
file has not been altered since signing. It does not prove that the action
authorized by that signature was constitutionally permitted, ethically sound,
or within the scope of the signing authority.

Authorization flows from Tier 1 downward through the governance hierarchy
defined in `Admin/Governance_Charter.md`. No cryptographic mechanism substitutes
for that hierarchy. A signed instruction to override a Tier 1 Axiom is a
Constitutional violation regardless of the validity of the signature.

**The correct ordering:**
1. Governance legitimacy — defined by `Admin/Governance_Charter.md` Tier 1 Axioms
2. Authorization — granted through the human override doctrine defined there
3. Cryptographic enforcement — this file; verifies that authorized actions
   are executed with confirmed identity and integrity

Reversing this ordering — treating a valid signature as self-authorizing — is
the failure mode this file exists to prevent.

**On circular dependency risk:** The governance-cryptography chain carries an
inherent self-certification risk: governance defines override legitimacy,
cryptography enforces it, and integrity systems may eventually depend on both.
A fully self-certifying enforcement pipeline — where compromised governance
rewrites itself, signs the rewrite, and validates through its own enforcement
stack — is the highest-order failure mode this architecture must prevent.
The Trust Boundary Declaration addresses this philosophically. Structural
enforcement separation (immutable external root-of-trust, offline constitutional
anchor, human-ratified recovery source outside the repository execution
environment) is the unresolved mechanical requirement. See SEC-007a/SEC-007b.

**On permission-source trustworthiness:** Cryptographic verification assumes
the human operators issuing or ratifying overrides are not compromised, coerced,
or impaired. This assumption is not validated at current maturity. See SEC-ASM-006
and `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` EC-011 (Human governance adversary model
undefined). Until EC-011 is resolved, apply the interim authentication
requirements from `Admin/Governance_Charter.md` §Human Override Doctrine to
all Constitutional-class decisions.

## External Design Lineage (EDL)

**Purpose:** Log external engineering patterns — industry standards, historical
precedent, or cross-domain design ancestry (not limited to security or IT
standards; future rows may draw from aerospace redundancy doctrine, biological
systems, distributed consensus, or other domains) — as evidence weighed
against Forge doctrine, not as authority. Lazarus Forge's problem — rebuilding
trust from near-zero in a salvage-first, potentially decade-isolated
environment — is related to but not identical to the problem most external
standards solve ("protect a system that already exists"). This library makes
each departure from, or adoption of, external practice an explicit,
falsifiable design decision rather than an implicit assumption, and gives
future agents a place to see *why* without re-litigating the comparison.

External design patterns and standards are treated as evidence of successful
prior engineering, not evidence of universal truth. They provide tested
starting points, not binding authority. Forge adopts, modifies, departs from,
or observes external practices only after evaluating them against
constitutional principles, operational constraints, and empirical reality.
This guards against two opposite failure modes: Not-Invented-Here rejection
of external wisdom out of isolationist bias, and uncritical Appeal to
Authority adoption purely because a practice is an established standard.
Ties to EF-0.0 (Reality is sovereign) and EF-0.1 (What Is Not Evidence) —
industry consensus is prior evidence, not verification.

**Scope note:** This registry is local to Security_Protocols.md for now. A
repository-wide mandatory schema, and any automated harness enforcement tied
to it, is a structural governance change requiring human ratification per
`Admin/Governance_Migration_Protocol.md` — proposed but **not adopted** this
session. See Resolution Log.

### Lineage Status Lifecycle

Every entry holds one of these explicit states:

- **Researching** — source identified; analysis of intent, edge cases, and failure modes underway
- **Survey Complete** — external practice fully mapped; dependencies and failure modes documented
- **Decision Drafted** — Forge-specific posture (Adopt/Modify/Depart/Observe) formulated but unverified
- **Validated** — validation path cleared; decision active in a specification layer
- **Superseded** — shifting reality or higher-priority doctrine has rendered the decision obsolete

**Decision definitions:**
- **Adopt** — external pattern applies with no material change
- **Modify** — core principle adopted, mechanism changed for Forge's constraints (no trusted hardware assumed, no continuous connectivity, no external institutions)
- **Depart** — the pattern's underlying assumption does not hold for Forge; different approach required
- **Observe** — external practice has not converged, or is moving too fast to standardize on; inherits a hard 2-cycle Expiry Watch — failure to advance to Survey Complete or Decision Drafted within that window is a review trigger, not an automated repository-wide hold (see Scope note above)

*Note on Validation Needed vocabulary: labels below are descriptive, not yet
checked against `Admin/Canonical_Terms.md` for drift against the Verification
Maturity Model states in `Admin/Forge_Audit_Kit.md`. Flag for reconciliation
at next Canonical_Terms.md audit.*

### External Design Lineage Registry

| PAT-ID | Target Unknown | External Source | Problem | External Pattern | Forge Decision | Validation Needed | Status | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PAT-001 | SEC-007a | NIST SP 800-57 / FIPS 140-3; PKI root anchor governance | External root-of-trust — constitutional requirements for the anchor | Hardened, centralized HSMs + formal cryptographic key lifecycles | **Modify** | Constitutional ratification (human governing authority) | Decision Drafted | Adopts the principle that an anchor must be unmodifiable through the system it anchors. Departs from assuming permanent trusted hardware exists — Forge's anchor must survive salvage/bootstrap conditions. Constitutional floor requires human ratification, not technical proof alone; ties to the circular self-certification risk named in the Trust Boundary Declaration. |
| PAT-002 | SEC-007b | TCG / IETF secure and measured boot; air-gapped bootstrapping via manufacturer device certificates | External root-of-trust — physical implementation (offline HSM/EEPROM or equivalent) | Cryptographic signature validation baked into pristine, vendor-provisioned silicon | **Modify** | Hardware-in-the-loop testing; multi-agent review | Decision Drafted | Adopts measured-boot and air-gap principles. Departs from assuming manufacturer-issued device provenance — salvaged hardware carries none; bridges the gap with multi-operator physical validation tokens. Blocked pending SEC-007a; physical anchor design must implement whatever constitutional floor SEC-007a defines. |
| PAT-003 | SEC-005 | NIST SP 800-90; TPM/vTPM attestation, secure/measured boot | Trusted initialization environment for key generation | Isolated, high-entropy automated clean-room execution environments | **Modify** | Multi-agent review; operational deployment during Genesis Phase | Decision Drafted | Departs from clean-room and hardware-attestation-as-default assumptions. Interim definition uses human-supervised, air-gapped generation on Logic-Zero-verified hardware only (current restrictive interpretation, Section III.2). Formal closure gated on CT-004 (`Admin/Canonical_Terms.md`). |
| PAT-004 | SEC-011 | NIST post-quantum migration guidance; IETF hybrid classical+PQC transition patterns | Long-duration cryptographic continuity — entropy exhaustion, algorithm migration at Leviathan-class timescales | Phased migration to lattice-based post-quantum primitives | **Observe**, with a mandated extension | Future research; Observe entry, 2-cycle Expiry Watch | Researching | Monitors PQC convergence rather than standardizing early — industry has not converged and Forge cannot assume continuous access to current PQC infrastructure decades out. Extension: mandates an explicit low-overhead symmetric-key fallback path under entropy exhaustion. **Note:** this fallback is not covered by SEC-012 (SEC-012 is registered for asymmetric-crypto execution overhead on salvaged silicon — a different problem). If a symmetric-fallback-tree unknown is wanted, log it as a new ID (proposed SEC-013) rather than folding it into SEC-012. Routed to `Admin/Trajectories.md` as v1→v2 item. |

**Notes:**
- Add rows as new patterns or blockers surface; not limited to security-domain sources.
- Each Forge Decision should cite Axiom or doctrine ties where applicable.
- "Modify" is expected to be the most common outcome.
- Reconciled 2026-07-02 — this file's SEC-007 sidecar entry (below, Auditor Notes & Unknowns) is now split into SEC-007a/SEC-007b, matching `Unknowns.md` v4.4 and the split IDs PAT-001/PAT-002 are written against.

## Body

### I. Human Override Authentication & Verification (GOV-006)

**1. Multi-Signature Requirement**

No Tier 1 Constitutional Axiom or hard-line doctrine defined in
`Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` may be overridden or suspended by a single
human operator. High-severity overrides require dual-token signature or a
multi-party hardware confirmation rule.

The specific minimum quorum threshold (number and diversity of independent
agents or hardware systems required) is defined by GOV-008 in
`Admin/Governance_Charter.md`. This file's multi-signature requirement
is not operational until GOV-008 provides that threshold. Until GOV-008
is resolved, the interim authentication requirement from
`Admin/Governance_Charter.md` §Human Override Doctrine applies:
independent confirmation from a second human operator, external cryptographic
signature from an orthogonal system, or a dated physical or digital record
created outside the repository system.

**2. Interim Bootstrap Authentication**

In the absence of an established public key infrastructure (Genesis Phase),
overrides must depend on physical air-gapped challenges — such as localized
split-secret tokens or pre-shared multi-party cryptographic pads — to prevent
local agent subversion. This is an interim procedure. It does not satisfy
Phase 3 requirements. It satisfies the current interim authentication
requirement while GOV-008 and the full PKI implementation remain unresolved.

**3. No Automated Session Continuance**

Override assertions are transactional and ephemeral. They do not persist
across multiple agent runtime sessions or automated multi-agent compilation
cycles. Every override requires a discrete signature event.

An agent that received override authorization in a prior session carries no
residual authority into a new session. This prevents authority accumulation
across session boundaries — a known attack vector in multi-agent systems where
session state is not fully cleared between runs.

**4. Authentication Event Logging (SEC-REG-001)**

All override attempts — successful or refused — must be logged with:
- Timestamp (ISO 8601 UTC)
- Identity of requesting agent or operator
- Scope of override requested
- Authentication method used
- Outcome (authorized / refused / escalated)
- Cryptographic binding token (nonce, monotonic counter, or RIP block-hash) —
  see replay protection requirement below

Logs are append-only. Override logs are subject to the Resolution Log
integrity requirements defined in `Admin/Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md`.

**Replay Protection Requirement (SEC-REG-001-A):** All human override
signatures must bind a cryptographic nonce, a monotonically increasing
session counter, or a specific block-hash from the prior-state archival
system defined in `Admin/Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md` RIP-001.
This binding guarantees transactional uniqueness and prevents replay of
a valid intercepted signature block within the same session window or
across closely timed network partitions before log sync completes.
*(Placeholder — implementation pending RIP-001 resolution. Until operational,
treat each override as session-unique by requiring a second-operator
confirmation that the override is a new request, not a replay.)*

**5. Degraded-Operation Security Doctrine Note**

Security mechanisms that are operationally impossible during degraded recovery
conditions will predictably be bypassed and therefore cannot be treated as
reliable safeguards. Multi-party token coordination, append-only logging, and
partition handling all impose operational burden that increases under stress.

The design implication: security requirements must degrade safely, not fail
open. When signing hardware loses power, when a quorum cannot be assembled,
or when clock synchronization is unavailable, the correct behavior is
constrained operation or halt — not bypassing security requirements to maintain
throughput. See SEC-006 (timestamp trust) and SEC-001 (quorum under partition)
for the unresolved specifics.

**6. Human-Factors Attack Surface Note**

The override ratification process assumes operators are uncompromised,
uncoerced, and cognitively unimpaired. Side-channel attacks, social engineering
directed at operators holding tokens, and timing attacks on multi-signature
processes are not addressed at current maturity. Cross-reference:
- `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md` §V — operator impairment recognition
- `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` EC-011 — human governance adversary model
- SEC-008 — compromise detection criteria (pending)

Until SEC-008 and EC-011 are resolved, treat anomalous override patterns
(unusual timing, repeated requests, out-of-character scope) as escalation
triggers to human review.

---

### II. Phase 3 Cryptographic Enforcement (RIP-005)

*All claims in this section are Placeholder — enforcement mechanisms defined
here do not yet exist. This section is the specification target for future
implementation.*

**1. Automated Commit Signing**

Transitioning from human audit logs to cryptographic assertions, all files
at Candidate Specification maturity or above must be signed using an approved
node key-pair. *(Maturity states defined in `Admin/Forge_Audit_Kit.md`
§Verification Maturity Model — Candidate Specification, Provisional
Specification, and Operational Specification are the signing-eligible states.)*
Unsigned files at these maturity levels are treated as unverified regardless
of their declared status.

**2. Frozen Section Verification**

Sections explicitly designated as `<!-- FROZEN -->` by governance files must
maintain static hashes. The automated audit script (`Admin/AUDIT_HARNESS.py`)
shall verify that local file content matches signed historic blocks before
triggering compilation or deployment pipelines. *(Placeholder — AUDIT_HARNESS.py
Phase 1 checks are not yet implemented per RIP-002. Phase 3 frozen-section
verification is a downstream dependency of Phase 1 completion.)*

**3. Phase Implementation Ordering**

Phase 3 cryptographic enforcement is the third phase of the automation
migration path defined in `Admin/Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md`. It cannot
be claimed before Phases 1 and 2 are complete:

| Phase | Prerequisite                                      | Status             |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 1     | Structural checks in AUDIT_HARNESS.py             | Open — RIP-002     |
| 2     | Comparison checks requiring archived prior states | Open — RIP-001     |
| 3     | Cryptographic verification — this file            | Blocked by 1 and 2 |

Governance Enforcement State must not advance beyond actual implemented
capability. Claiming Phase 3 enforcement before Phases 1 and 2 are complete
is integrity theater.

**Note on Phase 2 / RIP-001 circular dependency:** SEC-001 (quorum recovery
under partition) references archived state access as a prerequisite for
emergency partition verification. However, archived prior states are a Phase 2
requirement that depends on RIP-001. To prevent circular blocking: archived
state read-access for emergency partition verification operates under a
read-only hardware bootstrap bypass that does not depend on active Phase 3
cryptographic execution state. This bypass is a manual human-supervised
procedure, not an automated fallback, until Phase 3 is operational.

---

### III. Salvaged Logic & Node Authentication (EL-006)

**Relationship to Electronics.md**

Component-level infiltration prevention for salvaged hardware — firmware
inspection protocols, Logic-Zero wipe procedures, and non-destructive
harvesting doctrine — is defined and owned by `Operations/Electronics.md`.
This section does not redefine that doctrine. It defines the administrative
authentication layer that sits above it: how nodes that have passed
Electronics.md validation are admitted into the trusted cluster.

A node that has passed Logic-Zero wipe and signature-verified bootstrap load
per Electronics.md doctrine is a candidate for cluster admission. Admission
itself requires the node identity verification procedures below.

**1. Zero-Trust Cluster Admission**

No salvaged or newly initialized node may join the local mesh or operational
network without completing both layers:
- Component-level trust: Logic-Zero wipe and signature-verified bootstrap
  load per `Operations/Electronics.md` EL-006 doctrine
- Node-level identity: key-pair registration and cluster admission handshake
  per this section

Passing one layer does not substitute for the other.

**2. Node Key-Pair Registration**

Each node must possess a unique key-pair generated within a trusted
initialization environment. *(Definition of "trusted initialization
environment" is pending — see SEC-005 and `Admin/Canonical_Terms.md` CT-004.
Until defined, apply the most restrictive interpretation: human-supervised,
air-gapped, on verified hardware only.)* Key generation must not occur on
the node's own hardware before that hardware has completed the Logic-Zero
wipe and bootstrap load. Key material generated on unverified hardware is
untrusted regardless of subsequent wipe procedures.

**3. Key Rotation Cycles**

Key rotation schedule is *(Placeholder — rotation period not yet defined;
see SEC-003)*. Until defined, treat key material as requiring rotation at
each major version transition (v0→v1, v1→v2) at minimum. Key retirement,
secure destruction, and operator-loss continuity doctrine are undefined —
see SEC-004.

**4. Admission Revocation**

A node whose key material is suspected compromised must be suspended from
cluster participation pending investigation. Suspension is reversible;
revocation is permanent. *(Full revocation doctrine is undefined — see
SEC-002.)* Criteria for generating compromise suspicion are undefined —
see SEC-009.

**Description:** What cryptographic fallback procedure executes if a
multi-node swarm experiences a permanent communication partition, leaving
isolated clusters below the required multi-signature threshold for override
authorization.

**Why It Matters:** Bounded, local autonomy could stall indefinitely during
critical recovery operations if a quorum cannot legally be met. A fallback
that is too permissive creates a partition-exploitation attack vector; one
that is too restrictive freezes legitimate operations.

**Resolution Path:** Deferred to GOV-008 (`Admin/Governance_Charter.md`) —
minimum hardware and agent quorum definition is a prerequisite input to any
fallback procedure defined here. SEC-001 cannot be resolved before GOV-008
closes. Once GOV-008 defines the minimum quorum, revisit with a concrete
fallback proposal: time-locked decay window, hardware-level fallback protocol,
or escalation to human override via interim authentication. Cross-reference
RIP-001 — partition recovery may require archived state access via read-only
human-supervised bootstrap bypass (see Phase Implementation Ordering note).

**Description:** The repository lacks defined procedures for key revocation
following confirmed or suspected compromise. Distinction between reversible
suspension and permanent revocation, revocation authority chain, propagation
to cluster nodes, and post-revocation re-admission criteria are all undefined.

**Why It Matters:** Without revocation doctrine, a compromised key remains
nominally trusted until the next rotation cycle. In adversarial or degraded
environments this window may be operationally significant.

**Resolution Path:** Deferred via Specification — define revocation authority
chain, propagation mechanism during degraded connectivity, re-admission
criteria, and suspension vs. revocation distinction. Cross-reference SEC-001
(partition affects propagation), GOV-006 (override node revocation requires
additional safeguards), and SEC-009 (compromise detection criteria must
precede revocation trigger definition).

**Description:** No rotation period is defined for node key-pairs. Version-
transition rotation is the current floor but no time-based or event-based
schedule exists.

**Why It Matters:** Indefinitely valid key material accumulates compromise
risk. Without a defined schedule, rotation is ad hoc and audit verification
of compliance is not possible.

**Resolution Path:** Deferred via Specification — define rotation triggers:
time-based (calendar interval), event-based (version transition, personnel
change, suspected exposure), and condition-based (hardware replacement,
Logic-Zero re-wipe). Cross-reference SEC-002 — rotation and revocation
must be consistent.

**Description:** Key lifecycle doctrine covers generation and partial rotation
but does not address: secure key archival for dormant nodes, secure destruction
procedures on retirement, inheritance or handoff under operator incapacitation,
and post-mortem recovery for long-duration or degraded deployments.

**Why It Matters:** Incomplete lifecycle doctrine creates key material that
exists in undefined states — neither active nor provably destroyed. In
long-duration autonomous deployments (Leviathan-class), operator incapacitation
and hardware retirement are expected conditions, not edge cases.

**Resolution Path:** Deferred via Specification — define: (1) archival doctrine
for dormant key material; (2) secure destruction verification procedure;
(3) operator-loss continuity — who inherits authority and through what
authentication path; (4) post-mortem recovery for hardware that cannot be
physically accessed. Cross-reference SEC-002 (revocation), SEC-003 (rotation),
and SEC-011 (long-duration cryptographic continuity) — all must form a coherent
lifecycle.

**Description:** Section III requires key-pair generation within a "trusted
initialization environment" but the term is undefined. It is currently
ambiguous whether trusted means: physically secured, cryptographically
verified, human-supervised, air-gapped, or some combination.

**Why It Matters:** Ambiguous trust boundaries in key generation are a primary
attack surface. An adversary who can influence the initialization environment
can compromise keys before they are ever used. The term must have a canonical
definition before this section is promoted.

**Resolution Path:** Deferred via Specification — define trusted initialization
environment in `Admin/Canonical_Terms.md` CT-004 with at minimum: physical
custody requirements, software verification requirements, network isolation
requirements, and attestation method. Until defined, the most restrictive
interpretation applies: human-supervised, air-gapped, on verified hardware
only — per interim note in Section III.2. Closing CT-004 closes this unknown.

**Description:** Authentication event logging requires ISO 8601 UTC
timestamps, but partitioned systems and air-gapped nodes frequently lose
reliable clock synchronization. The behavior of append-only logs under
degraded or absent time synchronization is undefined.

**Why It Matters:** Timestamp integrity is required for audit trail
interpretability. Logs with unreliable timestamps cannot establish
reliable event sequencing, which undermines the primary value of the
append-only log requirement.

**Resolution Path:** Deferred via Specification — define: (1) minimum
acceptable clock source for timestamping; (2) behavior when clock
synchronization is unavailable (hold entries with uncertainty flag,
use monotonic counter, or reject logging until sync restored); (3)
audit trail interpretation rules for entries with degraded timestamp
confidence. Cross-reference SEC-001 — partition scenarios are the
primary context where clock sync is lost.

### SEC-007a — External Root-of-Trust: Constitutional Requirements Undefined

**Description:** The governance-cryptography enforcement chain carries a
circular self-certification risk: governance defines legitimacy, cryptography
enforces it, and integrity systems may eventually depend on both. A
sufficiently compromised authority chain could theoretically rewrite
governance, sign the rewrite, and validate through its own enforcement
pipeline. This entry scopes the **constitutional question**: what must be
true of an external anchor for it to actually break the self-certification
loop — not how that anchor is physically built (see SEC-007b).

**Why It Matters:** This is the highest-order failure mode for the entire
enforcement architecture. The Trust Boundary Declaration addresses it
philosophically; this entry is the unresolved mechanical requirement. Until
an external trust anchor exists, the system depends entirely on human
discipline and the integrity of the governance documents themselves — which
are the things being protected.

**Resolution Path:** Cross-module — spans GOV-003 (integrity enforcement
architecture), GOV-005 (long-term constitutional stability). RIP-001 (prior-
state archival) is Resolved as of 2026-06-27 — GPG-signed Git release tags
establish a tamper-evident archival substrate that a signed offline
constitutional snapshot could build on, though a dedicated anchor is a
distinct requirement from general prior-state archival and remains open.
Minimum viable resolution: define at least one external trust anchor that
cannot be modified through the repository execution environment — offline
signed constitutional snapshot, hardware security module holding root keys,
or human-ratified recovery record stored outside all automated systems.
This is an above-repository architectural decision requiring human
ratification; no automated agent may resolve this unilaterally. Blocks
SEC-007b.

**Description:** Once SEC-007a defines what the constitutional anchor must
guarantee, this entry covers **how it is physically realized**: offline HSM,
EEPROM, signed physical media, or equivalent salvaged-hardware-compatible
mechanism. Salvaged hardware carries no manufacturer-issued device
provenance, so standard secure/measured-boot assumptions (pristine,
vendor-provisioned silicon) do not directly apply — see PAT-002.

**Why It Matters:** A well-defined constitutional anchor is inert without a
physical mechanism that actually implements it. This is the bridge between
governance doctrine and salvage-environment reality.

**Resolution Path:** Blocked pending SEC-007a — physical design cannot be
finalized until the constitutional floor it implements is defined. Cross-ref
`Operations/Electronics.md` for salvaged-hardware constraints and Logic-Zero
node admission. Requires hardware-in-the-loop testing and multi-agent review

**Description:** Override signature logging (SEC-REG-001) does not specify
a mechanism to prevent replay attacks. A valid intercepted signature block
could be replayed within the same session window or across closely timed
network partitions before log sync completes, allowing an adversary or
malfunctioning agent to re-execute an authorized action without new
ratification.

**Why It Matters:** Ephemeral, transactional override design (Section I.3)
is undermined if signatures are replayable. The append-only log cannot
distinguish a replayed signature from a genuine one without a uniqueness
binding mechanism.

**Resolution Path:** Add mandatory requirement to SEC-REG-001: all override
signatures must bind a cryptographic nonce, a monotonically increasing session
counter, or a specific block-hash from RIP-001 prior-state archival. Interim
procedure (pending RIP-001): require second-operator confirmation that the
override is a new request, not a replay. SEC-REG-001-A added to Section I.4
body as the interim declaration.

**Description:** Section III.4 specifies that a node whose key material is
"suspected compromised" must be suspended, but provides no doctrine for how
suspicion is generated. Detection criteria — checksum disagreement, behavioral
anomaly, failed attestation, impossible timestamps, anomalous override patterns
— are entirely absent.

**Why It Matters:** Without defined detection criteria, compromise response
is reactive and human-dependent. Silent compromise remains undetectable until
an observable failure occurs, which may be after significant damage.

**Resolution Path:** Add compromise detection subsection to Section III or
create a linked detection criteria annex. Minimum criteria: (1) checksum
disagreement with prior signed state; (2) attestation failure on cluster
admission; (3) timestamp anomaly beyond defined tolerance (cross-ref SEC-006);
(4) behavioral divergence beyond watchdog threshold (cross-ref CF-001).
Cross-reference SEC-002 — compromise detection must trigger the revocation
doctrine defined there.

**Description:** SEC-ASM-002 assumes Ed25519/SHA-256 remain robust, but no
procedure exists for migrating to replacement algorithms if those standards
are deprecated or compromised. Algorithm agility — the ability to switch
cryptographic primitives without breaking the trust chain — is undefined.

**Why It Matters:** Cryptographic standards have finite lifespans. Post-quantum
concerns and algorithmic vulnerabilities are not theoretical at decadal
timescales. A system that cannot migrate algorithms loses its trust guarantees
when the underlying primitives fail, with no recovery path.

**Resolution Path:** Define algorithm migration doctrine: (1) trigger conditions
for migration (published vulnerability, NIST deprecation, internal review
schedule); (2) migration procedure preserving audit trail continuity; (3)
re-signing requirements for existing signed artifacts; (4) transition window
during which both old and new algorithms are accepted. Cross-reference SEC-004
(key lifecycle) and SEC-011 (long-duration continuity) — all three form a
coherent long-duration security posture.

**Description:** Leviathan-class deployments imply decade-scale operation,
potential operator death or incapacitation, hardware replacement cycles,
and isolated nodes with no external connectivity. No doctrine addresses:
cryptographic entropy exhaustion over long timescales, migration across
cryptographic generations, algorithm deprecation, or authority continuity
after operator succession.

**Why It Matters:** Long-duration deployments will outlive individual
operators, specific hardware generations, and potentially current cryptographic
standards. Without continuity doctrine, trust chain breaks silently at an
undefined future point with no recovery procedure.

**Resolution Path:** Develop long-duration continuity doctrine addressing:
(1) entropy refresh mechanisms for isolated nodes; (2) authority succession
when operators are incapacitated or unavailable; (3) algorithm migration
timeline (cross-ref SEC-010); (4) hardware retirement and key archival
cross-ref SEC-004. Route to `Admin/Trajectories.md` as a v1→v2 transition
planning item — not required for v0 operational status but must exist before
Leviathan-class deployment is authorized.

  and `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md` added. Content unchanged.
- 2026-06-19: v0.5 revision — Four-agent audit pass (Gemini, Grok, ChatGPT,
  Claude). Nine changes: (1) SEC-ASM-006 added — permission-source
  trustworthiness assumption made explicit. (2) Trust Boundary Declaration
  updated with permission-source trustworthiness note and EC-011 cross-ref.
  (3) SEC-REG-001-A added to Section I.4 — replay protection requirement
  (nonce/counter/block-hash binding); interim procedure pending RIP-001.
  (4) Section I.6 added — Human-Factors Attack Surface Note; cross-refs
  Safety_Protocols.md §V and EC-011. (5) Phase 2/RIP-001 circular dependency
  clarified in Section II.3 — read-only human-supervised bootstrap bypass
  declared as resolution. (6) Section III.4 updated — SEC-009 cross-ref
  added for compromise detection. (7) SEC-008 logged — signature replay
  protection mechanism undefined. (8) SEC-009 logged — compromise detection
  criteria undefined. (9) SEC-010 logged — cryptographic algorithm migration
  doctrine undefined. (10) SEC-011 logged — long-duration cryptographic
  continuity undefined. (11) Two new Lessons Learned entries added. (12)
  Phase 2 bootstrap bypass Abandoned Path added. (13) Drift Indicators
  expanded with five new entries. Open Unknowns updated to 11.

- **2026-07-02** — External Design Lineage (EDL) section added, positioned
  after Trust Boundary Declaration and before Body. Four entries logged:
  PAT-001 (SEC-007a), PAT-002 (SEC-007b), PAT-003 (SEC-005), PAT-004
  (SEC-011). Renamed from working title "Security Pattern Library" per
  multi-agent review — EDL better reflects that future entries need not be
  security-domain sources. Lineage Status Lifecycle adopted (Researching /
  Survey Complete / Decision Drafted / Validated / Superseded). PAT-004
  rationale corrected: a proposed symmetric-fallback-tree unknown is
  explicitly distinguished from SEC-012 (SEC-012 remains scoped to
  asymmetric-crypto overhead on salvaged silicon; a symmetric fallback
  unknown would require new ID SEC-013 if logged). A companion proposal to
  canonize EDL as a repository-wide constitutional gate (GOV-MAND-009,
  blocking Exploration→Candidate Specification promotion file-wide, with
  automated AUDIT_HARNESS.py enforcement) was **not adopted** this session —
  flagged as a structural governance change requiring routing through
  `Admin/Governance_Migration_Protocol.md` two-track ratification, not
  session-level multi-agent consensus. Known drift: this file's own SEC-007
  sidecar entry has not yet been split into SEC-007a/SEC-007b to match
  `Unknowns.md` v4.4; PAT-001/PAT-002 are written against the split IDs
  pending that reconciliation. Open Unknowns unchanged at 11 (EDL logs
  decisions on existing unknowns; introduces no new ones itself).

- **2026-07-02** — SEC-007 sidecar entry split into SEC-007a (constitutional
  requirements, owning layer Admin) and SEC-007b (physical implementation,
  owning layer Operations; blocked pending SEC-007a), closing the reconciliation
  gap flagged in the entry immediately above. Downstream references corrected:
  Trust Boundary Declaration pointer, Relationship section (GOV-003/GOV-005
  dependency, GMP-004 cross-ref, RIP-001 cross-ref — RIP-001 also noted as
  Resolved), Status footer promotion-blocker list, and the EDL section's
  known-drift note. Open Unknowns 11 → 12 (split adds one entry; no new
  unknown introduced).

- **2026-07-02** — SEC-DS-001 logged and resolved in Active Disputes: the
  Grok/Gemini G3/G6 gate-maturity divergence flagged at this file's audit,
  per `Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md` §Dispute Handling Protocol (disputes are
  interpretation conflicts, tracked explicitly, not left to silently
  disappear). Resolved via `Admin/Forge_Audit_Kit.md` v1.5's new Gate Scope
  vs. Promotion Readiness clarification — gates test execution quality;
  open-unknown blocking is a separate promotion condition. Gemini's original
  scoring is structurally correct. No change to this file's promotion-blocker
  list (SEC-007a/b, SEC-005/CT-004, GOV-008, SEC-009) — those unknowns were
  never in dispute, only whether they belonged inside G3/G6 scoring.

## Relationship to Existing Documents

- `Admin/Governance_Charter.md` — Tier 1 constitutional source; GOV-006
  (human override authenticity) and GOV-008 (minimum agent quorum) are the
  originating unknowns this file resolves; Trust Boundary Declaration defers
  to the governance hierarchy defined there; Tier 1 Axioms are not subject
  to cryptographic override; GOV-003 and GOV-005 are cross-module dependencies
  for SEC-007a
- `Admin/Governance_Migration_Protocol.md` — GMP-004 (ratification
  authentication gap) explicitly cross-references SEC-007a as the resolution
  path; Tier 1 amendment ratification records are a primary use case for the
  external root-of-trust architecture defined in SEC-007a/SEC-007b
- `Admin/Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md` — RIP-005 is the originating
  unknown for Phase 3 enforcement; Phases 1 and 2 defined there are
  prerequisites to Phase 3 implementation here; RIP-001 (Resolved) cross-
  references SEC-001 and SEC-007a
- `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` — co-Tier 1; Anti-Weaponization and Life
  Preservation doctrines are not subject to override by any cryptographic
  mechanism regardless of signature validity; EC-011 (human governance
  adversary model) is cross-referenced in Trust Boundary Declaration and
  SEC-ASM-006
- `Admin/Safety_Protocols.md` — physical operator safety is outside the
  cryptographic scope of this file; referenced here because operator
  impairment recognition (Safety_Protocols.md §V) is a prerequisite for
  valid human ratification — an impaired operator's cryptographic signature
  is technically valid but governmentally suspect; cross-referenced in
  Section I.6
- `Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md` — Tier 2; authentication event logs subject
  to audit trail requirements defined there
- `Admin/Forge_Audit_Kit.md` — Tier 3; Verification Maturity Model referenced
  in Section II for signing eligibility; SEC- prefix in Sidecar ID Reference
- `Admin/Canonical_Terms.md` — CT-004 (trusted initialization environment
  definition) is a pending addition required before Section III.2 can be
  promoted; closing CT-004 closes SEC-005
- `Operations/Electronics.md` — component-level infiltration prevention
  owner; Logic-Zero wipe is Layer 1 prerequisite for node admission here;
  complementary layers, not overlapping owners
- `Admin/Trajectories.md` — SEC-011 (long-duration cryptographic continuity)
  to be logged as v1→v2 transition planning item
- `Unknowns.md` — SEC-008 through SEC-012 to be registered/reconciled at
  next Unknowns.md update; SEC-007 split (SEC-007a/SEC-007b) registered
  there as of v4.4 pending sync into this file's own sidecar
- External Design Lineage registry (this file, above) — PAT-001 through
  PAT-004 anchor SEC-007a, SEC-007b, SEC-005, and SEC-011 respectively;
  citable from Unknowns.md and future audits

## Status

Version 0.8 — SEC-DS-001 (Grok/Gemini G3/G6 dispute) logged and resolved via
`Admin/Forge_Audit_Kit.md` v1.5 (2026-07-02). SEC-007 sidecar split into
SEC-007a/SEC-007b, reconciling with
`Unknowns.md` v4.4/v4.5 (2026-07-02); underlying audit maturity unchanged
since four-agent pass (2026-06-19).

**Gate status:** G1 cleared, G2 cleared, G3 cleared (Exploration-appropriate),
G4 cleared, G5 cleared, G6 cleared. No gates blocked at Exploration stage.
Promotion to Candidate Specification blocked by SEC-007a/SEC-007b (external
root-of-trust — constitutional and physical layers),
SEC-005/CT-004 (trusted initialization environment), GOV-008 (minimum quorum),
and SEC-009 (compromise detection criteria).

**What must remain constant:**

**Cryptographic verification confirms identity and integrity.**
**It does not confer governance legitimacy.**
**Authorization flows from Tier 1 downward.**

# AUDIT_HARNESS.py — Version History

Full changelog for `Admin/AUDIT_HARNESS.py`, relocated out of the
script's own docstring as of v14 (2026-07-13). Newest entries first.
Add new entries here, not back into the .py docstring.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CHANGES IN THIS PATCH (v14 → v15, 2026-07-16):
  - Root fix, not a relabeling: CURRENT_CYCLE (manual per-session
    counter) and UNKNOWN_FIRST_CYCLE / Admin/unknown_cycles.json
    (cycle-number registry, built at v14) removed entirely.
    Admin/Canonical_Terms.md §4 ratifies Cycle = one calendar year by
    default — confirmed 2026-07-16 (human) that this was ratified
    specifically to keep Expiry Watch from being too aggressive.
    CURRENT_CYCLE incremented per session, not per year, so every aging
    computation under it was roughly 26-50x more aggressive than the
    ratified intent, not merely mislabeled. See
    Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md's Adversarial Audit Layer (2026-07-14
    Battery finding) and Admin/Governance_Charter.md's GOV-013 drafting
    session (2026-07-16) for the evidence chain.
  - Replacement: every unknown's own sidecar entry already carries a
    required "First Logged: YYYY-MM-DD" field. extract_boundary() now
    captures that date alongside each UID (result["unknowns"] is a list
    of (uid, first_logged) tuples, was a list of uid strings — the one
    breaking change, both consumers in this file updated). check_aging()
    computes age in real elapsed days against EXPIRY_THRESHOLD_DAYS = 365
    (Canonical_Terms.md §4 default). No registry to fetch, maintain, or
    keep in sync with newly-registered unknowns — the data was already
    present and authoritative; v14's JSON map was solving the wrong
    problem (bulk of a redundant registry) instead of the actual one
    (aging computed in the wrong unit).
  - First Logged extraction required widening the field-table snippet
    window used during sidecar parsing: the existing 8-line window
    (sized for the Resolved/Discharged check, left unchanged) doesn't
    reach First Logged for the 8-field GOV-*/AP-* convention. Added a
    second, boundary-based snippet (scans to the next `##`/`###` header,
    capped at 30 lines) specifically for the date search, rather than
    widening the existing window and risking a behavior change to the
    Resolved/Discharged check it wasn't built for.
  - Verified before shipping: behavioral test against synthetic sidecar
    entries (open/recent, open/old, resolved/old — correctly excluded,
    no-date) confirmed correct extraction, exclusion, and aging in both
    directions; a second pass against real Admin/Governance_Charter.md
    content confirmed the fix in practice — GOV-001 through GOV-013 are
    1-55 days old, not "8 cycles," and none are overdue under the real
    365-day threshold. The prior SESSION BOUNDARY INDEX language reporting
    those same unknowns as "8 cycle(s) open" (see a 2026-07-16 audit,
    same day) was the miscalibration this patch removes.
  - format_boundary_index() output changed accordingly: header now reads
    threshold in days with a Canonical_Terms.md citation instead of
    "Current cycle: N"; overdue lines report days and an approximate
    year figure instead of a bare cycle count; unknowns with no
    parseable First Logged date are now listed explicitly (age unknown,
    not silently flagged either way) rather than disappearing from the
    aging report.
  - Admin/unknown_cycles.json is no longer fetched by this harness and
    is now orphaned — left in the repository as history (Routing.md
    2026-07-16 note), not registered as a live cross-reference, not
    deleted.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CHANGES IN THIS PATCH (v13-patched-4 → v14, 2026-07-13):
  - Structural split, no audit-logic behavior change. Prompted by file
    size review: ~380 of 1130 lines were static data or history rather
    than logic (this changelog: 133 lines; UNKNOWN_FIRST_CYCLE: 105
    lines; ALIASES/FALLBACK_REGISTRY: 86 lines; EXTRA_FILES catalog: 46
    lines). Addressed the two safely-externalizable pieces; left the
    rest in place, see rationale below.
  - Cell 3.5, UNKNOWN_FIRST_CYCLE: extracted from an inline dict to
    Admin/unknown_cycles.json (grouped by category for readability,
    flattened at load time), fetched via the existing fetch() mechanism.
    Registered in ALIASES as "unknown_cycles.json" — not
    FALLBACK_REGISTRY, since the dynamic Routing.md parser only matches
    backtick paths ending in .md or .py, so a .json entry there would
    never resolve on the (typical) path where Routing.md fetch succeeds;
    ALIASES is merged in on both the success and failure paths. On fetch
    or parse failure, harness now logs a warning and falls back to an
    empty mapping (all aging reported as unmapped) rather than halting —
    consistent with how other non-critical fetch failures are already
    handled. Net effect: registering a new unknown ID's first cycle is
    now a JSON edit, not a .py diff. Extraction verified by
    ast.literal_eval cross-check against the original dict before this
    file was written — 316/316 entries matched exactly.
  - Docstring changelog (this history): relocated from the
    AUDIT_HARNESS.py top docstring into this file. Motivation is not
    just size — the v13-patched-2 and v13-patched-3 entries below both
    document external audits (Grok, 2026-07-11) citing stale "still
    missing" status because this docstring hadn't been updated after
    the underlying files were fixed. Keeping a long, easy-to-miss
    history embedded in the same script that's re-pasted into Colab
    every session was part of what let that staleness persist
    unnoticed; a standalone changelog file doesn't fix staleness by
    itself but removes the specific "buried in 140 lines of docstring"
    failure mode.
  - _enforce_phase1(): split the three inline Phase 1 checks into named
    functions (_check_ethical_anchor, _check_required_fields,
    _check_cross_refs), called in the same order as before. Pure
    isolation refactor — same checks, same Finding objects, same
    control flow (including the sys.exit(1) quarantine halt on
    constitutional mutation, which stays in _check_ethical_anchor). Goal
    is that a future fix to one check — same pattern as the bold-key and
    lean-schema fixes in v13-patched-4 below — doesn't require re-reading
    the other two checks to confirm nothing else changed.
  - ALIASES and FALLBACK_REGISTRY were considered for the same JSON
    externalization and rejected. FALLBACK_REGISTRY's only job is to
    keep the harness usable when Routing.md's fetch fails; moving it to
    a JSON file fetched from the same GitHub source would mean a dead
    connection takes out the primary lookup and its own fallback
    together. Both dicts stay hardcoded in AUDIT_HARNESS.py.
  - EXTRA_FILES commented catalog (Cell 2) was also considered and left
    alone — unlike the two dicts above, it's a per-session UI the user
    edits directly (uncommenting lines to add context files), not a
    lookup table maintained separately from its use.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CHANGES FROM v12:
  - Cell 1: FALLBACK_REGISTRY — added Chaos_Dynamics.md (Tests/).
    Already discoverable via dynamic parse — Routing.md's Master Routing
    Map gained a real row for it 2026-07-04 (created same date). Added
    here per this file's own established practice of also mirroring new
    files into the fallback safety net, not because dynamic parse needs it.
  - Cell 2: EXTRA_FILES commented list — added Chaos_Dynamics.md under
    Tests/ section for discoverability, flagged no-File-State-table.
  - KNOWN OPEN ITEM list — closed out the v12 item "Routing.md does not
    yet list Challenges/Return_To_Eden.md": that row was added 2026-07-04.
    Drift-detection print in _build_registry() should now report sync on
    that entry; if it still reports drift, Routing.md's row format may not
    match the backtick-path regex in _parse_routing() and needs a look.
    New KNOWN OPEN ITEM added for Chaos_Dynamics.md: no File State table
    as of this compile (confirmed via direct fetch, 2026-07-04) — same
    situation Return_To_Eden.md was already flagged for. Phase 1 will log
    a MAJOR/STRUCTURE "File State table not found" finding the first time
    it's fetched. Also missing the mandatory Navigation Anchors block
    (Routing.md backlink requirement) — this harness does not currently
    check for that block's presence at all (Phase 1 checks File State
    fields and cross-references, not the Navigation Anchors block itself),
    so it will NOT surface as a Phase 1 finding; tracked here instead until
    either the file is patched or a fourth Phase 1 check is added for it.

CHANGES IN THIS PATCH (v13 → v13-patched, 2026-07-07):
  - PC-005 (Closed_Loop_Feedstock.md registration): confirmed already
    present in FALLBACK_REGISTRY under Challenges/ — no change needed there.
  - Cell 3.5, extract_boundary(): sidecar-unknown detection previously only
    matched the "## Auditor Notes..." + "### UID" convention used by Gate_
    files. Challenges/Closed_Loop_Feedstock.md logs its ten CLF- unknowns
    as a markdown table under "## 6. Open Unknowns" instead — the old logic
    would have silently reported "none open" for a file carrying three
    Critical unknowns (CLF-003, CLF-004, CLF-006). Broadened to also
    trigger on any "Open Unknowns" header and match table-row IDs
    (| CLF-001 | ...), with inline Resolved/Discharged status checks since
    table format keeps status in the same row rather than 8 lines below.
  - Cell 3.5, UNKNOWN_FIRST_CYCLE: added CLF-001 through CLF-010 at cycle
    10. Previously unmapped — Expiry Watch could never fire for this file's
    unknowns (age reported as None, not overdue) with no visible indicator
    anything was missing from the map.
  - Cell 2, EXTRA_FILES menu: added Closed_Loop_Feedstock.md under
    Challenges/ section, with a note flagging the CLF-005 Φ_ext symbol
    collision against Return_To_Eden.md so an auditor working either file
    is prompted to consider pulling in the other.

CHANGES IN THIS PATCH (v13-patched-3 → v13-patched-4, 2026-07-12):
  - _parse_file_state() — fixed a bold-key parsing bug that caused every
    File State field using markdown bold formatting (`| **Status** |`
    rather than `| Status |`) to be stored under a key like "**Status**"
    instead of "Status", silently breaking every downstream lookup.
    This affected Check 1 (Ethical Anchor presence/mutation) and Check 2
    (required-field presence) for a large share of the repository —
    Water.md, Waste.md, Biofouling.md, Critical_Minerals.md,
    Planned_Obsolescence.md, Emergence.md, Energy_Scarcity.md,
    Trophic_Forge.md, Support_Raft.md, Living_Waters.md, and most other
    files edited in recent sessions all use bolded keys. Prior to this
    fix, Phase 1 would have reported Ethical Anchor and every required
    field as absent on all of them — a false positive, not a real
    constitutional or structural gap. Found 2026-07-12: three independent
    second-agent audits run against `Challenges/Energy_Scarcity.md`
    reported Status, Verification Ref, and Ethical Anchor as missing,
    when all three were plainly present in the source file. Verified the
    bug by direct regex test before patching, and re-verified against the
    live file after — both fields now parse correctly.
  - _enforce_phase1() Check 2 — added lean-schema detection. Files
    declaring `Challenges Subtype: Problem-Statement` in their File State
    table are now checked against the lean field set the subtype doctrine
    in `Admin/File_Template.md` actually sanctions (Status, Verification
    Ref, Ethical Anchor) rather than the full 11-field schema
    _bootstrap_rules() pulls from File_Template.md's own example table.
    Before this fix, every Problem-Statement Challenges file would have
    thrown false MAJOR/STRUCTURE findings for Spec Gates, Body Stability,
    Last Audit, Auditor, Open Unknowns, Active Disputes, Highest Risk,
    and Sidecar Link — none of which that subtype is supposed to carry.
    Same root incident as the bold-key fix above.
  - Neither fix has been run against the full repository yet — both were
    verified against `Challenges/Energy_Scarcity.md` and `Challenges/Water.md`
    specifically. A full Phase 1 sweep post-patch would be worth doing to
    confirm no other required-field or Ethical Anchor findings in past
    audit sessions were false positives from these two bugs.

CHANGES IN THIS PATCH (v13-patched-2 → v13-patched-3, 2026-07-12):
  - FALLBACK_REGISTRY — added Energy_Scarcity.md (Challenges/), new file
    created same date (v0.1, not yet Gate 1-reviewed). Also mirrored into
    Discovery.md (tree listing, file registry table, Scope Map entry),
    Routing.md (routing table), Unknowns.md v4.19 (new ES- cluster,
    ES-001 through ES-003), and README.md (External Challenges list,
    Status section file count) same day.
  - Cell 2: EXTRA_FILES commented list — added Energy_Scarcity.md under
    Challenges/ section. Also removed two stale annotations found while
    editing this block: Chaos_Dynamics.md's "no File State table yet" and
    Return_To_Eden.md's "no File State sidecar yet" — both were fixed in
    earlier sessions (Chaos_Dynamics.md received its full template
    skeleton 2026-07-12; Return_To_Eden.md's File State table predates
    this harness version) but the comments here were never updated to
    match. Same staleness pattern as the KNOWN OPEN ITEM entries closed
    out in the v13-patched-2 changelog below — docstring maintenance
    lagging actual file state, not a live repository gap.

CHANGES IN THIS PATCH (v13-patched → v13-patched-2, 2026-07-11):
  - KNOWN OPEN ITEM list — closed out both entries below. Direct fetch
    confirms Challenges/Return_To_Eden.md and Tests/Chaos_Dynamics.md
    both now have complete File State tables; Chaos_Dynamics.md also has
    its Navigation Anchors block. These were flagged stale after an
    external audit pass (Grok, 2026-07-11) cited them as still-missing —
    root cause was this docstring not being updated after the files were
    patched, not a live repository gap. See also: Unknowns.md v4.17,
    which had the same staleness problem on CLF-005/RE-UNK-001 and has
    been corrected.
  - NEW KNOWN OPEN ITEM added below: Index Sync Check proposal (Grok,
    2026-07-11) — harness currently has no automated check comparing a
    file's own Resolution Log dates against Unknowns.md's Active Index
    status for the same ID. This is what let CLF-005 sit Resolved in its
    owning file for four days while Unknowns.md still listed it Open,
    which then propagated as a false positive into an external audit.
    Proposed: a fourth Phase 1 check, or a lightweight WARNING tier, that
    flags any ID where the owning file's Resolution Log shows a later
    Resolved/Discharged date than what Unknowns.md's Active Index carries.
    Not implemented in this patch — flagged for scoping next session.

KNOWN OPEN ITEM (flag for next session, not fixed here):
  - Index Sync Check (see above) — not yet designed or implemented.
    Scoping questions for next session: does this run against every ID
    on every Phase 1 pass (cost/latency), or only on the specific file
    being audited plus its cross-referenced IDs? Where does the harness
    get the owning file's Resolution Log date from — new fetch logic, or
    reuse of the existing boundary extractor?

CLOSED THIS PATCH (previously KNOWN OPEN ITEM, verified resolved 2026-07-11):
  - Challenges/Return_To_Eden.md's missing File State sidecar table —
    confirmed present and complete via direct fetch.
  - Tests/Chaos_Dynamics.md's missing File State table and Navigation
    Anchors block — both confirmed present via direct fetch.

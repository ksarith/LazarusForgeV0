## File Purpose

Solar Descent is a concentrated solar energy architecture that deliberately separates the surface collection layer from the underground processing and storage mass. Energy harvested at the surface is routed downward — either as photons via optical downlink or as enthalpy via thermal fluid downlink — to an insulated subterranean chamber where it performs high-temperature industrial work, drives power conversion, and cascades waste heat to secondary systems.

The organizing paradox: the surface exists only to collect. The underground exists only to work. By separating these functions, the system gains thermal stability from planetary mass, removes high-temperature processing from surface exposure, enables larger thermodynamic differentials for conversion efficiency, and concentrates industrial heat at a point protected from environmental degradation.

Two downlink pathways diverge at the transport stage and reconverge at the underground chamber:

- **SD-001 — Optical Downlink:** Concentrated sunlight is routed underground as light via fiber optic bundles or reflective light wells.
- **SD-002 — Thermal/Fluid Downlink:** Concentrated sunlight heats a working fluid at the surface; that fluid carries enthalpy underground via insulated piping.

Both pathways feed the same underground chamber. The chamber architecture, power conversion cascade, and safety systems are shared. Pathway selection is site-conditioned and resource-conditioned — the two are not mutually exclusive and may be co-deployed.

This file lives in Tests/ because excavation requirements are unvalidated at Forge scale, temperature claims are theoretical, and no prototype combining salvage-first construction with underground solar concentration has been demonstrated.

## Body

### Organizing Principle

Conventional concentrated solar power places all thermal mass, processing, and conversion infrastructure at or near the surface. This exposes high-temperature systems to environmental degradation, imposes surface footprint costs, and limits the thermodynamic differential available for conversion efficiency.

Solar Descent inverts this. The surface layer is minimized to a collection aperture. Everything that benefits from stability, insulation, and thermal mass is placed underground. The planet itself becomes the insulation jacket, the vibration damper, and the thermal reservoir.

The two downlink pathways diverge in transport physics but share a destination:

```
Surface Collection Layer (heliostats, parabolic concentrators, tracking arrays)
      ↓                              ↓
SD-001 Optical Downlink     SD-002 Thermal/Fluid Downlink
(photons via fiber/well)    (enthalpy via molten salt/oil)
      ↓                              ↓
      └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                     ↓

         Primary Output (electrical / mechanical)
                     ↓
         Waste Heat Cascade (LW-001, space heating, process heat)
```

### Surface Collection Layer (Shared)

Both downlink pathways draw from the same surface collection infrastructure.

**Aperture Design**
- Low-profile heliostat arrays or static parabolic concentrators optimized for flux density, not immediate conversion.
- Surface footprint minimized — collection area is the only justified surface presence.
- Tracking systems preferred for maximum daily flux capture; static concentrators acceptable for bootstrap phase.

**Structural Shielding**
- Surface components require durable environmental protection: self-cleaning glass covers, automated dust shutters, UV-resistant housing.
- Sacrificial outer surfaces preferred over protected inner components — replace the shield, not the concentrator.
- Biofouling management required in humid climates. See Challenges/Biofouling.md.

**Salvage Component Targets**
- Parabolic dish reflectors: salvaged satellite dishes, resurfaced with reflective film or polished aluminum sheet.
- Tracking actuators: salvaged linear actuators, stepper motors, automotive window motors.
- Structural frames: salvaged steel tube and angle iron.
- Cover glass: tempered glass salvaged from appliances, shower enclosures, commercial glazing.

### SD-001 — Optical Downlink

**Concept**

Concentrated sunlight is coupled into fiber optic bundles or vertical reflective light wells and routed directly underground as photons. The underground focal point receives light and converts it to heat at the chamber receiver.

**Advantages**
- No working fluid required — eliminates pump complexity and fluid sourcing.
- Optical energy can be directed with precision to a small focal zone.
- Modular — additional fiber bundles add capacity without redesigning the fluid circuit.
- Compatible with direct photochemical reactions at the focal point (solar fuels, chemical synthesis) in addition to thermal applications.

**Challenges**
- Fiber attenuation limits total flux delivery over long vertical runs.
- Fiber entry ends require cooling or protection against damage at high input flux (>400 kW/m² demonstrated to cause damage in research systems).
- Coupling efficiency between concentrator and fiber bundle is a significant loss point.
- Dust and contamination in the shaft degrade optical transmission over time.

**Achievable Temperature Range (proposed — unvalidated at Forge scale)**

| Configuration | Projected Temperature | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| Salvage-grade silica fiber, single dish | 500–1000°C | Low |
| Optimized silica fiber bundle, multi-dish array | 1000–2000°C | Low |
| Sapphire fiber, inert atmosphere cavity | 2000–3000°C theoretical | Very Low |
| Research peak (Israeli fiber solar, narrow hot zone) | ~2400°C reported | External reference only |

All figures are proposed parameters pending empirical testing at Forge build quality. Degraded performance should be assumed for initial planning.

**Salvage Component Targets**
- Fiber optic bundles: industrial process fiber, medical fiber optic light guides, salvaged telecommunications fiber (lower flux tolerance — requires characterization).
- Light well alternatives: polished stainless steel tube, salvaged aluminum irrigation pipe with reflective interior lining.
- Secondary concentrators at fiber input: compound parabolic concentrators (CPC) fabricated from polished salvaged sheet metal.

#### SD-001a — Molten Tin Fiber Termination (Experimental Sub-Concept)

**Concept**

At the underground end of the optical downlink, glass rods or fiber ends are submerged in a shallow pool of molten tin. The molten tin acts as a reflective liquid interface — redirecting light that exits the fiber ends into the chamber receiver while the tin bath itself absorbs and transfers heat to the surrounding thermal storage medium.

**Physical Basis**
- Molten tin is highly reflective for visible and near-infrared wavelengths due to free-electron metallic reflectivity.
- The float glass process demonstrates stable, optically useful glass-tin contact is achievable (molten glass floating on molten tin in commercial float glass manufacture).
- A glass-tin interface acts as a dynamic, self-healing secondary reflector — minor surface contamination re-merges into the liquid bath rather than permanently fouling a solid surface.

**Temperature Constraints**
- Molten tin melting point: ~232°C. Boiling point: ~2602°C.
- At focal temperatures approaching silicon vaporization (>2600°C), tin would vaporize, creating convective instability and optical disruption.
- Practical operating window: **800–1500°C** at the tin bath surface. Above this, vapor pressure and convective boiling degrade the optical interface.
- Silica glass rods soften under load below 1700°C — sapphire rods (melting point ~2040°C) are preferred for sustained high-temperature operation.

**Failure Modes**
- Tin oxidation forming dross layer — destroys reflectivity. Mitigation: inert atmosphere (argon purge) in the termination cavity.
- Tin vapor contamination of downstream processing zone — critical concern for any purity-sensitive application (silicon processing, chemical synthesis). Mitigation: physical separation of tin bath from processing zone.
- Glass rod wetting failure — bubbles or tin penetration at the interface scatter light. Mitigation: mechanical immersion pressure; evaluate gallium or gallium-indium alloys as alternative liquid metal with lower vapor pressure.
- Convective turbulence at high flux — disrupts optical interface geometry. Mitigation: limit input flux to maintain bath below boiling threshold.

**Alternatives Worth Evaluating**
- Gallium or gallium-indium (Galinstan) alloys — lower melting point (~30°C for Galinstan), lower vapor pressure than tin at elevated temperatures, demonstrated in liquid metal mirror applications.
- Shallow molten tin pool above the fiber termination rather than submersion — fiber ends deliver light downward onto the tin surface rather than through it.
- Liquid metal mirrors (gallium alloys) adapted from telescope mirror applications.

**Status:** Highly experimental. Partial viability demonstrated in analogous applications. Requires dedicated test rig before any integration into main SD-001 pathway.

**SD-001 Proposed Test Parameters**

- **SD-TEST-101 (Flux Delivery Measurement):** Measure actual photon flux delivered to underground focal point per unit collection area across fiber bundle lengths of 5 m, 10 m, 20 m. Establish attenuation rate per meter and minimum viable bundle specification.
- **SD-TEST-102 (Fiber Entry Cooling):** Characterize thermal damage threshold at fiber input end under concentrated flux. Establish cooling requirement (passive, active airflow, water jacket) to sustain continuous operation.
- **SD-TEST-103 (Underground Focal Temperature):** Measure actual temperature achieved at underground cavity receiver under SD-001 delivery at Forge-scale collection area. Compare against ASM-002 projected range.
- **SD-TEST-104 (Molten Tin Interface Stability):** Dedicated test rig for SD-001a. Measure reflectivity, optical interface stability, and contamination rate over sustained operation under controlled atmosphere. Establish viable operating temperature window.
- **SD-TEST-105 (Shaft Contamination Rate):** Measure optical transmission degradation over 30-day period in shaft environment. Establish cleaning cycle interval.

### SD-002 — Thermal/Fluid Downlink

**Concept**

Concentrated sunlight heats a working fluid at a surface receiver. The fluid — molten salt or high-temperature synthetic oil — carries thermal energy underground via vacuum-insulated vertical piping. Underground, the fluid transfers heat to the storage medium and returns to the surface to be reheated.

**Advantages**
- Mature technology base — molten salt thermal storage is well-established in commercial CSP.
- No optical coupling losses — thermal transfer is more tolerant of surface contamination than fiber optics.
- Working fluid doubles as thermal storage medium if circulated through the underground chamber directly.
- Easier to scale throughput by increasing pipe diameter or adding parallel circuits.

**Challenges**
- Working fluid sourcing — molten salts and synthetic oils are industrial products; salvage sourcing is uncertain.
- Freeze risk — molten salt systems must maintain minimum temperature continuously or face solidification and pipe blockage.
- Gravitational head pressure management — downward column assists pumping down; return pump must overcome full fluid column weight back to surface.
- Vacuum insulation on vertical piping is demanding to fabricate from salvaged materials.
- Fluid degradation at extreme temperatures — synthetic oils have upper temperature limits (~400°C); molten salts extend to ~600°C; liquid metals (sodium, tin) required above that.

**Working Fluid Options**

| Fluid | Operating Range | Salvage Compatibility | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Synthetic thermal oil (Therminol, Dowtherm) | Up to ~400°C | Low — specialty product | Freeze point low; manageable |
| Molten nitrate salt (60% NaNO₃ / 40% KNO₃) | 220–600°C | Medium — industrial chemical | Freeze risk below 220°C |
| Liquid sodium | 98–880°C | Low — specialist handling | High reactivity with water; serious safety concern |
| Molten tin | 232–2600°C | Medium — recoverable from salvage | High temp viable; vapor pressure at extremes |

**Pressure and Head Loss**
- At 20 m depth, a molten salt column exerts ~40 kPa additional head pressure on the return pump.
- Downward pumping is gravity-assisted; fluid column weight reduces pump work on the descent stroke.
- Net energy cost of fluid circulation must be characterized against thermal delivery — this is the parasitic load of SD-002.

**Salvage Component Targets**
- High-temperature piping: salvaged steam boiler pipe, stainless industrial process pipe.
- Insulation: salvaged mineral wool, ceramic fiber blanket, perlite fill for annular insulation.
- Pumps: salvaged centrifugal or gear pumps rated for high-temperature fluid.
- Surface receiver: salvaged pressure vessel, modified with selective absorber coating.

**SD-002 Proposed Test Parameters**

- **SD-TEST-201 (Fluid Delivery Efficiency):** Measure thermal energy delivered underground vs. collected at surface across pipe lengths of 5 m, 10 m, 20 m. Establish heat loss rate per meter and minimum viable insulation specification.
- **SD-TEST-202 (Parasitic Pump Load):** Measure electrical energy required to circulate working fluid through vertical circuit. Establish net energy delivery ratio (thermal delivered / pump energy consumed). Reject configurations below ratio of 10:1.
- **SD-TEST-203 (Freeze Recovery Protocol):** Simulate loss of surface collection (night, cloud cover) and measure time-to-freeze at minimum insulation specification. Establish freeze prevention protocol (trace heating, drain-back, minimum flow).
- **SD-TEST-204 (Fluid Degradation Rate):** Measure working fluid thermal stability over 30-day sustained operation at target temperature. Establish fluid replacement interval.

### Underground Chamber (Shared — Both Pathways)

The underground chamber is the reconvergence point. Whether energy arrives as photons (SD-001) or as fluid enthalpy (SD-002), it enters a common thermal storage and conversion environment.

**Chamber Architecture**

- **Thermal storage medium:** Rock/gravel bed, packed sand, or phase-change material matrix. High-grade heat injected at chamber top; cool medium drawn from bottom and returned to surface loop.
- **Thermal stratification:** Natural buoyancy maintains temperature gradient. Hot zone at top, cool zone at bottom. Preserves temperature differential for conversion efficiency.
- **Insulation:** Chamber walls lined with salvaged mineral wool, ceramic fiber, or perlite. Surrounding earth becomes passive secondary insulation jacket as it equilibrates over time.
- **Geomechanical constraint:** Operating temperature ceiling strictly bounded by host rock thermal expansion limits. Temperature must remain below fracturing threshold for local geology. See SD-UNK-004.
- **Atmosphere:** Inert atmosphere (argon or nitrogen purge) preferred for any pathway involving molten metal components or high-purity processing. Passive gravity-fed pressure relief venting for steam spike or containment breach.

**Self-Discharge Rate**

Heat leaks into surrounding bedrock continuously. Self-discharge rate (% of stored energy lost per day) is a function of insulation thickness, temperature differential, and chamber geometry. This must be characterized empirically — it sets the minimum daily solar input required to maintain operating temperature.

---

### Power Conversion Cascade (Shared)

Energy extraction from the underground chamber follows a grade-prioritized cascade. Higher-grade heat performs higher-value work first; waste heat from each stage becomes input to the next.

```
Underground Chamber (high-temperature thermal storage)
      ↓
Tier 1 — High-Grade Heat (>500°C)
      → Stirling engine (mechanical / electrical output)
      → sCO₂ turbine if available (higher efficiency, lower salvage probability)
      → Direct high-temperature industrial process (pyrolysis feed, chemical reduction)
      ↓
Tier 2 — Mid-Grade Waste Heat (200–500°C)
      → Secondary Stirling stage
      → Process heat for Gate_05_Separation_Thermal.md operations
      ↓
Tier 3 — Low-Grade Waste Heat (<200°C)
      → LW-001 Vacuum Distillation (waste heat as thermal input — direct synergy)
      → LW-008 Multi-Effect Vacuum Distillation
      → Space heating
      → Drying operations (lumber, salvage materials)
      ↓
Thermal baseline reset (fluid returns to cold side of storage)
```

**Conversion Technology Assessment**

| Technology | Salvage Probability | Efficiency | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stirling engine | Medium — appears in specialty salvage | 25–40% thermal-to-mechanical | Preferred v0 candidate |
| sCO₂ turbine | Very Low — industrial specialty | 45–55% | Declared future pathway; not v0 viable |
| Steam turbine (small) | Low-Medium | 15–25% at small scale | Requires pressure vessel certification |
| Thermoelectric generator (TEG) | High — consumer electronics | 5–8% | Low efficiency; viable for bootstrap instrumentation power only |

### Safety Governance

Consistent with Forge doctrine: physical boundaries and passive mechanisms take precedence over software overrides.

**Optical Shutoff (SD-001)**
- Mechanical optical shutters at surface concentrator output drop automatically on thermal runaway signal — physically severs photon delivery without requiring electrical power.
- Gravity-actuated design preferred: shutter falls closed on loss of holding current rather than requiring active closure signal.

**Fluid Circuit Shutoff (SD-002)**
- Gravity-fed bypass valves redirect working fluid away from the underground chamber on overpressure or overtemperature signal.
- Drain-back design: fluid drains to a surface holding tank by gravity on pump failure, preventing underground solidification.

**Underground Chamber**
- Passive weighted pressure-relief vents prevent catastrophic pressure buildup from steam spike or fluid breach.
- Acoustic emission monitoring for structural shifting — anomalous readings trigger defocused state at surface collection array.
- Temperature sensors at multiple chamber depths — triple-redundant per Cognitive_Frameworks.md doctrine; sensors lie, cross-reference is required.

**Thermal Runaway Definition**
- Chamber temperature exceeds host geology fracturing threshold: immediate full shutoff, both pathways.
- Self-discharge rate increases >50% above baseline without change in insulation: investigate structural integrity before resuming operation.

**Description:** ASM-002 projects 1000–2000°C based on research literature. Forge build quality using salvaged components will underperform research systems. Actual achievable temperature determines which conversion technologies are viable and which industrial processes can be driven.

**Resolution Path:** SD-TEST-103 empirical measurement. Until resolved, power conversion planning must assume conservative lower bound (~500°C) to avoid designing for temperatures the system cannot reach.

**Description:** The maximum safe operating temperature of the underground chamber is bounded by the thermal expansion and fracturing threshold of the host rock. This is entirely site-specific — limestone, granite, sandstone, and clay all behave differently under thermal cycling. No universal answer is possible.

**Description:** Molten salt and high-temperature synthetic oil are industrial specialty products. Salvage sourcing path has not been identified. Molten tin is more recoverable from the salvage stream but introduces contamination and vapor pressure risks at high temperatures.

**Resolution Path:** Component audit of local industrial salvage stream. If no viable fluid is found, SD-002 requires new-purchase input — a doctrine conflict requiring human decision.

## Drift Indicators

Standard mandatory re-audit conditions per File_Template.md apply.

**Additional file-specific drift indicators:**

- SD-UNK-004 (host geology) remains open and Body content begins specifying chamber dimensions → mandatory human review. Chamber design without geology assessment is a safety violation.
- SD-UNK-002 (achievable temperature) remains unresolved and power conversion pathway is selected based on ASM-002 alone → flag as premature commitment; re-audit before any hardware procurement.
- SD-001a (molten tin) content migrates from sub-concept to primary pathway without SD-TEST-104 completion → reject migration; return to sub-concept status.
- Liquid sodium reappears as a working fluid candidate without dedicated containment infrastructure assessment → immediate escalation to Safety_Protocols.md review.
- Any reference to grid-scale power export targets before v3 milestone → scope violation; flag for human review.
